The 11-time All-Star closer became the first player in major league history to reach the plateau for one team and the 15th to make it overall. Jones homered in the second inning and Teixeira in the third off Jo-Jo Reyes, who matched a major league record by making his 28th consecutive start without a win.\\n2011: Infielder Wilson Valdez wound up as the winning pitcher when the Philadelphia Phillies needed 19 innings to outlast the Cincinnati Reds 5-4. Valdez threw a hitless 19th inning in his first professional pitching appearance. He became the first position player to become a winning pitcher since Colorado catcher Brent Mayne on Aug. 22, 2000.\\n2012: Nelson Cruz hit a grand slam and tied his career high with eight RBIs, Josh Hamilton hit his 19th home run of the season and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 14-3. Cruz's grand slam came in the seventh inning and gave Texas a 14-1 lead. He also had a three-run double in the first and an RBI single in the sixth.\\n2013: Angel Pagan became the first San Francisco player to end a game with an inside-the-park homer, connecting with a runner aboard in the bottom of the 10th inning to give the Giants a 6-5 victory over Colorado. The last major leaguer to hit an inside-the-park home run that ended a game was Rey Sanchez for Tampa Bay on June 11, 2004 -- also in a 10-inning victory over Colorado.\\n2014: Josh Beckett of the Dodgers records the first no-hitter of the year by blanking the Phillies, 6-0. It is the first no-hitter by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo pitched one in 1996, and the first nine-inning no-hitter by an opposing pitcher in Philadelphia since Bill Stoneman of the Montreal Expos back in 1969.\\n2019: The Padres set a franchise record with 7 homers in a 19-4 win over the Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre. Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe hit two each while Austin Hedges blasts a grand slam off Edwin Jackson. Cal Quantrill is the beneficiary of this power display as he records his first career victory a short distance from his hometown of Port Hope, ON, while another local boy, Josh Naylor from Mississauga, ON, collects his first three big league hits for the Padres in the game.\\n2021: By working home plate in a game between the Cardinals and White Sox, Joe West sets a new career record with 5,376 games as an umpire, passing Bill Klem, whose last game was in 1941.\\n2022: Anaheim City Council votes unanimously to cancel the sale of Angel Stadium and surrounding land to Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno, following the resignation of Mayor Bill Sidhu on corruption charges a few days earlier. The $350 million sale had been agreed in December 2019 but not yet finalized, and was at the center of an FBI investigation that led to accusations that Sidhu had provided insider information to the team and in return demanded kickbacks in the form of campaign contributions. The city councillors are now no longer convinced that the proposed deal reflects the city's best interests, and are willing to risk a breach of contract lawsuit from Moreno in order to examine a potential deal again, starting from scratch.\\n\\nMay 26\\n1916: Benny Kauff of the Giants was picked off first base three times by Boston's Lefty Tyler. The miscues didn't hurt as New York won its 14th consecutive road victory beating the Braves, 12-1.\\n1925: In Detroit's 8-1 win over the Chicago White Sox, Ty Cobb became the first to collect 1,000 career extra-base hits. He finished his career with 1,139.\\n1929: Pinch-hitters Pat Crawford of the Giants and Les Bell of the Boston Braves hit grand slams in New York's 15-9 victory.\\n1930: Joe Sewell of the Cleveland Indians, who fanned only three times in 353 at-bats during the season, was struck out twice in the same game by Pat Caraway of the White Sox.\\n1937: Billy Sullivan and Bruce Campbell appeared for the Cleveland Indians as pinch hitters. Each hit a home run, making this the first time two American League pinch hitters hit home runs in the same game. The Indians beat the Athletics, 8-6.\\n1956: Cincinnati Reds pitchers John Klippstein, Hershell Freeman and Joe Black combined for 9 2-3 hitless innings, but lost 2-1 in 11 innings to the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1959: Harvey Haddix of Pittsburgh pitched 12 perfect innings before losing to Milwaukee 1-0 in the 13th on an error, a sacrifice and Joe Adcock's double.\\n1962: Sandy Koufax struck out 16 Phillies to lead the Dodgers to a 6-3 victory.\\n1969: Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hits his 500th career double, becoming only the third major leaguer to reach 500 doubles and 500 home runs.\\n1995: Southern California and Fresno State combined for an NCAA postseason baseball record of 39 runs in the Trojans' 22-17 win in the West Regional. USC scored three runs in the top of the ninth to break the record of 37 set by the Trojans and Houston in 1990.\\n1996: The Chicago White Sox became the 16th team in AL history to hit four homers in one inning in their 12-1 win over Milwaukee. Frank Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura hit consecutive homers and Chad Kreuter added another in Chicago's seven-run eighth.\\n1997: Chicago's Sammy Sosa and the Pirates' Tony Womack hit inside-the-park homers in the sixth inning of the Cubs' 2-1 win. It was the first time two inside-the-park homers had been hit in the same inning in 20 years.\\n2004: Daryle Ward hit for the cycle and tied his career best with six RBIs in Pittsburgh's 11-8 win over St. Louis.\\n2006: Derek Jeter gets his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth player in Yankees history to reach the milestone.\\n2008: Chase Utley tied the National League lead with his 16th homer and drove in six runs as Philadelphia routed Colorado 20-5. The Phillies batted around three times and had season-highs in hits (19) and runs.\\n2011: The hot-hitting Boston Red Sox routed the Detroit Tigers 14-1 in an eight-inning, rain-shortened game. The Red Sox, who beat Cleveland 14-2 the previous day, scored at least 14 runs in back-to-back games for the first time since 1998.\\n2016: Major League Baseball hands out a suspension of 82 games to Braves OF Hector Olivera, following a domestic violence incident in April. It is by far the most severe penalty yet handed out under baseball's new domestic violence policy.\\n2018: Mike Trout has the first five-hit game of his career and drives in 4 runs to lead the Angels to an 11-4 win over the Yankees.\\n2021: Commissioner Rob Manfred issues his ruling following the completion of the investigation of allegations of improper behavior towards a number of women against former manager and coach Mickey Callaway. Callaway is found guilty of violating Major League Baseball policies and is declared ineligible for the remainder of this season and all of 2022, after which he may apply for reinstatement. For their part, the Angels fire him from his position of pitching coach, from which he has been suspended since the allegations surfaced in February, and the Indians, who were Callaway's employer when some of the offensive incidents took place, state that they will take steps to ensure a more respectful environment in which employees feel empowered to denounce workplace harassement in the future.\\n2023: Craig Kimbrel becomes the eighth pitcher to record 400 career saves in Philadelphia's 6 - 4 win over the Braves, barely two weeks after Kenley Jansen became the seventh.\\n\\nSubject: Domestic violence; Breach of contract; Professional baseball; Campaign contributions; Criminal investigations\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Subject: Breach of contract\\n\\nLocation: Texas; Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Chicago Illinois; New York; United States--US; Detroit Michigan; Colorado; Los Angeles California\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: Chicago Cubs; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cleveland Indians; NAICS: 711211; Name: Philadelphia Phillies; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cincinnati Reds; NAICS: 711211; Name: Chicago White Sox; NAICS: 711211; Name: Boston Red Sox; NAICS: 711211\\n\\nTitle: ON THIS DATE\\n\\nPublication title: Chicago Tribune; Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nFirst page: 4\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 25, 2025\\n\\nSection: Sports\\n\\nPublisher: Tribune Publishing Company, LLC\\n\\nPlace of publication: Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: General Interest Periodicals--United States\\n\\nISSN: 10856706\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: News\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207346388\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/on-this-date/docview/3207346388/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright Tribune Publishing Company, LLC May 25, 2025\\n\\nLast updated: 2025-05-25\\n\\nDatabase: U.S. Newsstream Collection\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "   - Topic Modeling: Identify major themes or topics discussed across the articles using techniques like LDA or NMF on the 'Full Text'.\n",
      "   - Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the articles or specific sections of the text.\n",
      "   - Keyword Extraction: Extract important keywords or phrases from the 'Full Text' to understand the main subjects of each article.\n",
      "   - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify and classify named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) mentioned in the text.\n",
      "   - Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of the 'Full Text' for quicker understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Link-Based Analyses (using the 'Links' column):\n",
      "   - Frequency of Links: Count how many articles contain links.\n",
      "   - Types of Linked Resources: Categorize the types of resources being linked to (e.g., news articles, institutional websites, databases).\n",
      "   - Domain Analysis: Analyze the domains of the linked URLs to understand the sources being referenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Combined Analyses (correlating information from different columns):\n",
      "   - Sentiment Analysis by Date: Analyze how the sentiment of articles changes over time.\n",
      "   - Topic Trends over Time: Track how the prevalence of certain topics evolves across different dates.\n",
      "   - Correlation between Topics and Links: Investigate if articles discussing specific topics tend to link to certain types of resources or domains.\n",

Ruth connected once off Red Lucas and twice off Guy Bush.\\n1941: Boston's Ted Williams raised his batting average over .400 for the first time during the season. Williams finished the season batting. 406.\\n1951: Willie Mays, a highly touted rookie for the Giants, went 0-for-5 in his debut against the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1982: Ferguson Jenkins became the seventh pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters in the Chicago Cubs' 2-1 loss at San Diego. Jenkins reached the milestone by striking out Garry Templeton in the third inning.\\n2001: Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs allowed one hit and struck out 14 in a 1-0 win over the Brewers. Wood took a no-hit bid into the seventh before giving up a leadoff single to Mark Loretta.\\n2001: Hideo Nomo of the Boston Red Sox tossed a one-hitter and struck out 14 in a 4-0 win over Toronto. Nomo faced one batter over the minimum of 27, giving up a leadoff double in the\\nfourth to Shannon Stewart.\\n2002: Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers homered twice in a 10-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, setting a major league record with seven homers in his last three games.\\n2005: The St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-1, in 12 innings, as manager Tony La Russa wins his 823rd game with the Cardinals, passing Whitey Herzog for second place on the franchise list. La Russa is 218 victories behind Cardinals leader Red Schoendienst.\\n2009: Jim Thome passes Mike Schmidt for 13th on the all-time home run list, as the White Sox thump the Angels, 17-3.\\n2011: Andruw Jones hit a pair of two-run homers, Mark Teixeira also hit a two-run shot and Mariano Rivera made a milestone appearance in New York's 7-3 victory over Toronto. Rivera pitched the ninth inning in a non-save situation, the 1,000th game he's played for the Yankees. The 11-time All-Star closer became the first player in major league history to reach the plateau for one team and the 15th to make it overall. Jones homered in the second inning and Teixeira in the third off Jo-Jo Reyes, who matched a major league record by making his 28th consecutive start without a win.\\n2011: Infielder Wilson Valdez wound up as the winning pitcher when the Philadelphia Phillies needed 19 innings to outlast the Cincinnati Reds 5-4. Valdez threw a hitless 19th inning in his first professional pitching appearance. He became the first position player to become a winning pitcher since Colorado catcher Brent Mayne on Aug. 22, 2000.\\n2012: Nelson Cruz hit a grand slam and tied his career high with eight RBIs, Josh Hamilton hit his 19th home run of the season and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 14-3. Cruz's grand slam came in the seventh inning and gave Texas a 14-1 lead. He also had a three-run double in the first and an RBI single in the sixth.\\n2013: Angel Pagan became the first San Francisco player to end a game with an inside-the-park homer, connecting with a runner aboard in the bottom of the 10th inning to give the Giants a 6-5 victory over Colorado. The last major leaguer to hit an inside-the-park home run that ended a game was Rey Sanchez for Tampa Bay on June 11, 2004 -- also in a 10-inning victory over Colorado.\\n2014: Josh Beckett of the Dodgers records the first no-hitter of the year by blanking the Phillies, 6-0. It is the first no-hitter by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo pitched one in 1996, and the first nine-inning no-hitter by an opposing pitcher in Philadelphia since Bill Stoneman of the Montreal Expos back in 1969.\\n2019: The Padres set a franchise record with 7 homers in a 19-4 win over the Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre. Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe hit two each while Austin Hedges blasts a grand slam off Edwin Jackson. Cal Quantrill is the beneficiary of this power display as he records his first career victory a short distance from his hometown of Port Hope, ON, while another local boy, Josh Naylor from Mississauga, ON, collects his first three big league hits for the Padres in the game.\\n2021: By working home plate in a game between the Cardinals and White Sox, Joe West sets a new career record with 5,376 games as an umpire, passing Bill Klem, whose last game was in 1941.\\n2022: Anaheim City Council votes unanimously to cancel the sale of Angel Stadium and surrounding land to Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno, following the resignation of Mayor Bill Sidhu on corruption charges a few days earlier. The $350 million sale had been agreed in December 2019 but not yet finalized, and was at the center of an FBI investigation that led to accusations that Sidhu had provided insider information to the team and in return demanded kickbacks in the form of campaign contributions. The city councillors are now no longer convinced that the proposed deal reflects the city's best interests, and are willing to risk a breach of contract lawsuit from Moreno in order to examine a potential deal again, starting from scratch.\\n\\nMay 26\\n1916: Benny Kauff of the Giants was picked off first base three times by Boston's Lefty Tyler.

Pro football's new kickoff rule, he insists, is ruining the game. Trading NBA powerhouse Luka Doncic from the Mavericks to the Lakers was a terrible move. And Major League Baseball \\\"should get off its fat, lazy ass\\\" and finally put the Cincinnati Reds' Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame.\\nBut unlike other fans, Trump has direct lines to elite athletes and the commissioners of the major sports leagues. He has been using those connections not just to share his strong opinions but to shape his image, engage in international diplomacy and, in some cases, to intervene in America's sports establishments as he has in other major sectors of American business.\\nMany presidents have used sports as a way to relate with ordinary Americans. But Trump -- who owned a professional football team in an upstart league, hosted boxing matches at his Atlantic City casino and partners with Saudi-backed LIV Golf for events at his clubs -- is going further than his predecessors in harnessing athletics for political gain. With his talent for inserting himself into the controversy of the moment, Trump is showing that he shares the interests of millions of sports fans and is ready to express their collective grievances.\\nIn just the past few weeks, Trump discussed the four-year-old system for paying college athletes with legendary football coach Nick Saban and said afterward that he wants to rework it. He demanded that the University of Pennsylvania nullify the records of a transgender swimmer. He mused that an incentive for Russia to end the war in Ukraine could be to reverse the ban on its competing in the 2026 World Cup -- which the U.S. is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.\\nTrump met with baseball's top official to argue his case for Rose, the late All-Star player disgraced by a gambling scandal. Last week, baseball took a step toward fulfilling Trump's wish, as MLB commissioner Rob Manfred removed Rose from the list of players banned from the Hall of Fame, making him eligible to be considered for the honor.\\nIn February, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. That same month he made a splashy entrance at the Daytona 500, flying over the crowd in Air Force One and then taking a lap around the racetrack in the presidential limousine.\\n\\\"He loves to be around competitors,\\\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.), a former head coach at Auburn University who discussed the college athlete compensation system while flying with Trump earlier this month. In part Trump was concerned, Tuberville said, that the need for colleges to devote money to pay high-profile stars in the biggest collegiate sports is hurting their funding for less popular sports and women's sports -- potentially weakening U.S. medal chances in the upcoming Olympics.\\n\\\"Trump often uses sports to associate himself with winning, which has always been an obsession for him,\\\" said sports and politics historian Frederic J. Frommer. Trump has referred to the late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner as an especially close friend, Frommer notes. \\\"You can see why. They shared a win-at-all-costs mentality.\\\"\\nOn weekends Trump generally golfs at one of his clubs, often joined by professional athletes, business executives and politicians. People who have played with him say he likes to trash-talk -- and hates to lose. Golfer Tiger Woods, who has been friendly with Trump for several years, called him earlier this year to say he was dating Trump's former daughter-in-law Vanessa Trump, mother to five of the president's grandchildren. \\\"I said, 'Tiger, that's good,\\\" Trump told reporters. \\\"I'm very happy for both.\\\"\\nThis past Wednesday, when the NCAA champion University of Florida basketball team, the Gators, made a celebratory visit to the White House, Trump recapped their winning effort as if he were behind the desk at SportsCenter.\\n\\\"So, in the championship game against the Houston Cougars, what became one of the most hard-fought title games in college basketball history, the first half was a battle over every point, with both teams playing ferocious defense and the lowest-scoring first half of a championship game since 2011,\\\" Trump recounted. \\\"The Gators fell behind, and it was looking bad.\\\"\\n\\\"But in the second half, Florida stormed back with a 14 and three run,\\\" he went on. \\\"With less than 60 seconds left on the clock, Houston led by one point. Houston then fouled Alijah Martin, giving him two free throws, which he easily sank.\\\" Trump turned to Martin and asked, \\\"Were you nervous?\\\" The player shook his head no. \\\"Oh, if you didn't sink 'em, you wouldn't be up here right now,\\\" Trump said as the room burst into laughter. He then invited the team to tour the Oval Office.\\nDuring his first term, Trump famously feted Clemson University's football squad with a buffet of fast food including McDonald's Big Macs and fries. Back then, some teams boycotted Trump. In 2018, the president abruptly canceled a celebration for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles because many players said they would refuse to attend over Trump's criticism of athletes who knelt during the national anthem as a statement on racism.\\nThe Eagles won again this year, and much of the team showed up to the White House, though others, including several big stars, were still holdouts. Trump even weighed in on the controversial \\\"tush push\\\" play, where teammates shove the quarterback from behind to gain a pivotal yard or two, a tactic that the Eagles used to great success. \\\"I like it -- it's sort of exciting and different,\\\" Trump said. This week NFL owners took a vote on a proposed ban of the play, which failed.\\nWhite House guests and his audiences at public speeches often hear the president detour into the latest sports imbroglio. A new rule on kickoffs introduced by the NFL last season -- changing where players are positioned and when they can move -- has been a pet peeve for him, as for many other fans. \\\"The ball is in play, and you have two teams frozen in place, and it is the weirdest looking thing,\\\" he complained to conservative commentator Mark Levin earlier this year. He brought his opinion directly to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, privately needling him during an Oval Office event earlier this month, just before Trump announced that the NFL draft would take place on the National Mall in 2027.\\nIn some cases, Trump uses sports to signify masculinity and toughness. He has attended multiple competitions of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, one of the most violent sports on the American landscape. That instinct also appears to be behind his complaint about the kickoff-rule, which was adopted in part to reduce injuries: \\\"It's still a very violent game. And that's why people watch it. It's risky,\\\" Trump said, discussing his reasoning on a podcast co-hosted by football coach Bill Belichick. He added: \\\"You don't have to let your child play.\\\"\\nWith football fans gripped by the big surprise in this year's draft -- the unexpected shunning of the University of Colorado's Shedeur Sanders, a quarterback widely viewed as a first-round draft pick -- Trump took to social media to call team owners \\\"stupid\\\" for failing to pick him early.\\nTrump offered another hot take when his podcast hosts asked whether the explosion of sports gambling has threatened the integrity of games. \\\"Well, there will be corruption, and the only question is, will it be massive corruption, or will it be, you know, regular standard corruption?\\\" Trump ventured, before saying that it was \\\"ridiculous\\\" to keep Rose out of baseball's hall of fame because of his betting on games. \\\"You're going to have corruption. Where you have gambling, you have a lot of it,\\\" he said.\\nFar more than in his first term, Trump has used his powers to put his stamp on American culture generally, to elevate his own preferences as well as to combat institutions and ideas he deems too liberal. He promised to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of an alleged \\\"divisive, race-centered ideology\\\" that he says it used to rewrite American history. His decision to put himself forward as chairman of Washington's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts led to speculation that \\\"Memory,\\\" a favorite song of his from the musical \\\"Cats,\\\" would soon be heard on the stage.\\nBut sports have far more reach in American culture. And Trump has found ways to combine advertising his fandom with amplifying political positions that he believes favor him and his party. \\\"I love sports. I think I should have come here,\\\" he told graduates this month at the University of Alabama, before going on to condemn the participation of trans athletes in women's sports, which he banned in an executive order in February. \\\"As long as I'm president, we will always protect women's sports,\\\" he told the graduates. Men will not play in women's sports. No way.\\\"\\nTrump's immersion in sports helped him politically last year as he appeared on a series of podcasts and in other social media aimed at young men -- who ultimately swung heavily behind him in the election. With Joe Rogan, Trump talked about the value of golf for relaxation -- \\\"I was never one that could run on a treadmill\\\" -- and that, unlike in tennis, golfers of different skills can play together. A video that Trump made last summer with golf star Bryson DeChambeau has racked up 15 million views on YouTube.\\nHis courtship of sports media stars hasn't always paid off, however. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, for example, backed Trump in last year's election but has used his show to harshly criticize the president's tariff policy.\\nTrump's focus on sports has even become an element of foreign relations, beyond his golf clubs' deals with Saudi Arabia's LIV league in its challenge to the PGA Tour. Last week, while visiting the Middle East, Trump set aside time for a ceremony in which Qatar -- which also has promised Trump an airplane to use for Air Force One -- officially handed host duties over to the U.S. for next year's World Cup. The event, in which Trump and Qatar's emir signed the official soccer ball from the 2022 games, gave Trump another chance to praise his Qatari host and marvel at his palace.\\nThe U.S. will host both the World Cup and the 2028 Olympics at a time when Trump's tariffs and immigration restrictions have put it at odds with much of the world. The two events will give Trump a prestige position in sports that are followed by hundreds of millions of people around the globe. He sees drama in the fact that the U.S. will jointly host next year's soccer tournament with Canada and Mexico, two nations that have been stung by his tariffs. Asked how the trade dispute would affect the games, Trump said the tension was \\\"a good thing.\\\"\\n\\\"I think it's going to make it more exciting,\\\" he said.\\nBy Aaron Zitner and Alex Leary\\n\\nSubject: Sports fans; Bans; Athletic drafts & trades; Womens sports; Corruption; Professional baseball; Transgender persons; Athletes; Gambling; Presidents; Coaches & managers; College basketball; Scandals; Soccer; American culture; Sports rules\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Industry: 92111 :\\u200e Executive Offices 71121 :\\u200e Spectator Sports\\n\\nLocation: United States--US\\n\\nPeople: Trump, Donald J\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: National Football League--NFL; NAICS: 711211, 813990\\n\\nClassification: 92111: Executive Offices; 71121: Spectator Sports\\n\\nTitle: REVIEW --- Trump Wants to Remake The Sports World Too --- The president has strong views on everything from the NFL's kickoff rules to how college players get paid, and he's not bashful about using the power of his office to rewrite the rules of the game.\\n\\nPublication title: Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.\\n\\nFirst page: C1\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 24, 2025\\n\\nPublisher: Dow Jones & Company Inc.\\n\\nPlace of publication: New York, N.Y.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: Business And Economics--Banking And Finance\\n\\nISSN: 00999660\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: Commentary, Opinions\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207104378\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/review-trump-wants-remake-sports-world-too/docview/3207104378/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It was the first movie I saw in a theater (or in my case, a drive-in). Having grown up and regularly vacationed not that far from where it was shot, whenever I catch a snippet of \\\"Jaws\\\" on TV, even decades later, I am partly watching a film and partly seeing family photos, a childhood and home movies from New England beaches, circa 1974.\\nBoardwalk arcade games.\\nUnleashed dogs.\\nSuntan oil, not sunblock.\\nSublime lethargy, soundtracked in one scene by a beach radio that's faintly wafting Olivia Newton-John's \\\"I Honestly Love You\\\" -- although, trivia alert, in the film, it's a cover by Lynn \\\"Rose Garden\\\" Anderson, as well as a devilish example of a 28-year-old Steven Spielberg's genius for detail. Just as you hear it, the song is cued to: \\\"I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, remains uncomfortable and bittersweet, hilarious and rousing, and though Roy Scheider's sons in the film supposedly have New York accents, they sound much more working-class New England and when I hear them, I always get homesick. I catch glimpses of free-range summer vacations -- one of those sons takes a dingy into a pond, without supervision -- and mentally note coastal buildings and roads and landscapes irrevocably altered or no longer there. \\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, is more of a documentary. Every election cycle, I smile when someone posts a photo of the actor Murray Hamilton with a reminder: The mayor in \\\"Jaws\\\" is still mayor in \\\"Jaws 2.\\\"\\nThat said, from Cape Cod to saltwater-free Chicago, perhaps for you, the response was just as primal: \\\"Jaws\\\" inaugurated the lifelong feeling that something's down there, beneath us in the water, wherever we were swimming, even if we were wading in a neighbor's aboveground pool.\\nMy daughter once eye-rolled me, suspicious at my claim that \\\"Jaws\\\" kept people out of the water for years, regardless of whether that body of water was the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Michigan or a backyard swimming pool. I assured her, there's good reason Universal Pictures decided the tagline for \\\"Jaws 2\\\" needed to be: \\\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...\\\" There's even a clinical name for the phobia that \\\"Jaws\\\" appeared to exacerbate among a population who probably didn't know they had it to begin with: Thalassophobia, or the intense foreboding one feels around deep water and whatever exists under the surface.\\nAsk a film critic and they will confirm, regardless of whether they agree: \\\"Jaws\\\" gets routinely name-checked as one of the few perfect movies in the entire history of cinema, a movie so much about its own medium that in 1975 Pauline Kael wrote of running into a veteran director who was astonished by the young upstart director of \\\"Jaws.\\\" The filmmaker said that Spielberg \\\"must never have seen a play. He's the first one of us who doesn't think in terms of the proscenium arch. ... There's nothing but the camera lens.\\\"\\nHere's how that translated inside a theater: Audiences floated at the lip of the ocean, the waves casually slapping at the bottom of movie screens, reminding them, without spelling it out, that something's below. Here's how it translated after we left the theater: A horror flick irrevocably changed our relationship to swimming. Hitchcock's \\\"Psycho\\\" spoiled the long hot shower for a few years, but Spielberg ruined 70% of the Earth's surface.\\nA few weeks after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, a columnist at this newspaper, taking this temperature of alarm, reminded readers they had a better chance of being struck by lightning than being eaten by sharks. Besides, the (true-ish) story Quint tells in the film about the hundreds of soldiers killed by sharks after the U.S.S. Indianapolis sank -- an exaggeration. It wasn't hundreds, it was \\\"70 or 80 at most.\\\" Whew. A few months after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, the fear remained so real that another columnist noted: \\\"The silver screen knoweth no salt-water boundaries. Somewhere in the country, a swimmer may well be looking for a fin in his chlorinated pool at this very moment.\\\" Grabbing the feet of fellow swimmers had become a thing. Humming \\\"DunDunDunDUNDUN\\\" was already a cliche.\\nAsked by a reporter that summer if \\\"Jaws\\\" had already become indelible, Roy Scheider could not have answered more wrongly: \\\"Traumatic shocks in entertainment disappear.\\\"\\nSorry, Chief Brody, but for years afterward, reporters and editors at this paper received the occasional letter or phone call, from tourists testing Oak Street Beach, from visiting suburbanites, seeking reassurance, or just wondering: Could Lake Michigan contain a shark or two? Philip Willink, a researcher for the Illinois Natural History Survey, former senior biologist at Shedd Aquarium and co-author of the new \\\"Fishes of the Chicago Region: A Field Guide,\\\" remembers the movie creating \\\"all kinds of problems for regional fish biologists. I used to routinely get calls from concerned parents wondering if it was safe to let their kids swim at Chicago beaches -- or was there a risk of shark attack.\\\"\\nThere was not.\\nStill, the other day I spotted a bumper sticker: \\\"The Great Lakes: Unsalted and Shark Free.\\\" As Henry David Thoreau once wrote presciently: \\\"I have no doubt that one shark in a dozen years is enough to keep the reputation of a beach a hundred miles long.\\\"\\nRumors are pesky creatures: The big one that got going after \\\"Jaws\\\" was an urban legend about a boy named George Lawson who, depending on who told it, lost a leg to a shark in Lake Michigan or was eaten and never found. This did not happen. But what did was at least one hoax, as well as an incident biologists still debate. The hoax: In spring 1969, two fishermen pulled up a dead 29-inch-long shark off Milwaukee. After their catch created a bout of agita along Lake Michigan, a Wisconsin tavern owner admitted he had snagged a shark off Florida in 1967, and, for reasons lost to history, kept it in a refrigerator, presumably biding time until his killer prank. As recently as 2008, a dead two-foot-long blacktip shark was found near Traverse City, Michigan -- again, it was probably imported and then dumped, or so says the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\\nLess clear-cut is what happened in 1937 on the Mississippi River in Alton, Illinois: Though sharks are largely a saltwater species, fishermen working along the Missouri line pulled up a five-foot-long bull shark. Photographic evidence points to a bull; researchers at the time confirmed, yes, it's a bull. But just last year, a piece in the Detroit Free-Press described biologists as still split on whether that catch was just another hoax or, more likely, a terrific example of the adaptability of the bull shark.\\nLook, don't listen to me, try a professional fish man: Kevin Feldheim of the Field Museum, whose work focuses on the biology of sharks, said: \\\"Some sharks -- bulls in particular -- can tolerate fresh water and do swim quite far up rivers.\\\" Bulls are special. But he's never heard of a bull navigating fresh water as far north as a Great Lake. However, as a child in the Los Angeles suburbs, he did get interested in sharks because of \\\"Jaws.\\\" It never affected whether or not he swam in pools.\\n\\\"Although the movie 'Piranha' did.\\\"\\nConsidering that 1978's \\\"Piranha\\\" -- directed by a young Joe Dante and written by a young John Sayles -- was one of the first successful \\\"Jaws\\\" rip-offs, I believe this is splitting hairs. Irrational fear is not different from the panic sweeping beaches in \\\"Jaws.\\\"\\nThere's truth involved: When I was a kid, a friend whose home stood on stilts alongside a cove on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay -- which does see the occasional great white shark -- was convinced a great white ate his dog. In truth, it was likely a mako. Whew, again.\\nBut also, there's more perception than reality. Another friend of mine, an NCAA swimmer back in college, often finds herself in a freshwater lake in New York: \\\"When I am doing a long swim across the lake, I often think of the (\\\"Jaws\\\") poster and get myself all anxious.\\\" Brian Samuels, a Deerfield native and fishmonger at Dirk's Fish in Lincoln Park, informed me: \\\"I would not swim in public pools because of ('Jaws'). Not just that, but across the street from my house, a neighbor had a pool and I was convinced, beneath me in that dark water, there was a shark, because, of course, there had to be.\\\"\\nEven Gene Pokorny, principal tubaist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra -- who has played the infamously ominous tuba thumps in the \\\"Jaws\\\" score at Ravinia Festival while conducted by John Williams, its Oscar-winning composer -- does not swim in deep bodies of water, period. He always thinks of \\\"the guys from the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\\\" He also thinks of Tommy Johnson, his late friend and teacher, who played the tuba on the \\\"Jaws\\\" soundtrack. In fact, Pokorny was there at the recording:\\n\\\"I remember it clearly and I remember the circumstances were horrendous. I was there with three friends from the University of Southern California and we had managed to get permission to watch. I was in my last quarter of college at the time. We didn't really know anything about the film itself, but I remember (the recording session) was late in starting because Tommy, my tuba teacher, was also a regular instructor at a high school and it was rainy that day and the substitute who was coming to fill in for him was late. Plus, there's the traffic in LA. So everyone is already there waiting when Tommy comes crashing in. The whole orchestra is waiting. Tommy makes his way toward the back row and John Williams just goes, 'ARE you ready?' Tommy says 'Sure,' pulls out the music, looks at it, the red light goes on to record. He did it cold. There was a movie screen in the studio set to that first scene in the movie, with the woman swimming at night in the ocean. Tommy did not even have the right tuba that day, but the double bassists came in and he nailed it perfectly. It's what you hear in the movie, one of the most remarkable things. He played tuba on tens of thousands of film and TV scores, but this became his claim to fame. I remember thinking how the images on screen were perfectly complemented by this music. I remember watching with my mouth wide open.\\\"\\nI can think of no better illustration of the power \\\"Jaws\\\" that retains: Pokorny was present while its Hollywood mythology was being crafted, and he still can not swim in an ocean.\\nAs biologists have noted over the past 50 years, sharks ironically became the true victims of \\\"Jaws,\\\" villainized and exploited by industries that lobbed off fins for food. The upside is that sharks also became symbols of ocean conservation -- a cause that \\\"Jaws\\\" author Peter Benchley espoused during the last years of his life, before he died in 2006.\\nIn case you're wondering, the Florida-based International Shark Attack File says that, since 1975, less than 60 people have been killed by great white sharks, worldwide. Not one of those people was swimming in Lake Michigan. According to the Coast Guard's Great Lakes offices in Cleveland, shark sightings across the Midwest are now basically zilch.\\nStill, Willink, of the Illinois Natural History Survey, said he was vacationing last year on the South Carolina coast when he noticed a fin slice the ocean surface, not far from his son. They had recently watched the film for the first time, and though his son showed no fear of swimming in oceans, Willink's heart jumped into his throat. The scene in which a mother \\\"is wandering hopelessly and in grief along the surf is seared in my memory.\\\"\\nThat fin belonged to a bottlenose dolphin.\\n\\\"But my first thought was the movie 'Jaws.' \\\"\\n\\nThe Music Box hosts a 50th anniversary screening of \\\"Jaws\\\" in 35mm at 9 p.m. May 26; musicboxtheatre.com.

Ruth connected once off Red Lucas and twice off Guy Bush.\\n1941: Boston's Ted Williams raised his batting average over .400 for the first time during the season. Williams finished the season batting. 406.\\n1951: Willie Mays, a highly touted rookie for the Giants, went 0-for-5 in his debut against the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1982: Ferguson Jenkins became the seventh pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters in the Chicago Cubs' 2-1 loss at San Diego. Jenkins reached the milestone by striking out Garry Templeton in the third inning.\\n2001: Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs allowed one hit and struck out 14 in a 1-0 win over the Brewers. Wood took a no-hit bid into the seventh before giving up a leadoff single to Mark Loretta.\\n2001: Hideo Nomo of the Boston Red Sox tossed a one-hitter and struck out 14 in a 4-0 win over Toronto. Nomo faced one batter over the minimum of 27, giving up a leadoff double in the\\nfourth to Shannon Stewart.\\n2002: Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers homered twice in a 10-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, setting a major league record with seven homers in his last three games.\\n2005: The St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-1, in 12 innings, as manager Tony La Russa wins his 823rd game with the Cardinals, passing Whitey Herzog for second place on the franchise list. La Russa is 218 victories behind Cardinals leader Red Schoendienst.\\n2009: Jim Thome passes Mike Schmidt for 13th on the all-time home run list, as the White Sox thump the Angels, 17-3.\\n2011: Andruw Jones hit a pair of two-run homers, Mark Teixeira also hit a two-run shot and Mariano Rivera made a milestone appearance in New York's 7-3 victory over Toronto. Rivera pitched the ninth inning in a non-save situation, the 1,000th game he's played for the Yankees. The 11-time All-Star closer became the first player in major league history to reach the plateau for one team and the 15th to make it overall. Jones homered in the second inning and Teixeira in the third off Jo-Jo Reyes, who matched a major league record by making his 28th consecutive start without a win.\\n2011: Infielder Wilson Valdez wound up as the winning pitcher when the Philadelphia Phillies needed 19 innings to outlast the Cincinnati Reds 5-4. Valdez threw a hitless 19th inning in his first professional pitching appearance. He became the first position player to become a winning pitcher since Colorado catcher Brent Mayne on Aug. 22, 2000.\\n2012: Nelson Cruz hit a grand slam and tied his career high with eight RBIs, Josh Hamilton hit his 19th home run of the season and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 14-3. Cruz's grand slam came in the seventh inning and gave Texas a 14-1 lead. He also had a three-run double in the first and an RBI single in the sixth.\\n2013: Angel Pagan became the first San Francisco player to end a game with an inside-the-park homer, connecting with a runner aboard in the bottom of the 10th inning to give the Giants a 6-5 victory over Colorado. The last major leaguer to hit an inside-the-park home run that ended a game was Rey Sanchez for Tampa Bay on June 11, 2004 -- also in a 10-inning victory over Colorado.\\n2014: Josh Beckett of the Dodgers records the first no-hitter of the year by blanking the Phillies, 6-0. It is the first no-hitter by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo pitched one in 1996, and the first nine-inning no-hitter by an opposing pitcher in Philadelphia since Bill Stoneman of the Montreal Expos back in 1969.\\n2019: The Padres set a franchise record with 7 homers in a 19-4 win over the Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre. Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe hit two each while Austin Hedges blasts a grand slam off Edwin Jackson. Cal Quantrill is the beneficiary of this power display as he records his first career victory a short distance from his hometown of Port Hope, ON, while another local boy, Josh Naylor from Mississauga, ON, collects his first three big league hits for the Padres in the game.\\n2021: By working home plate in a game between the Cardinals and White Sox, Joe West sets a new career record with 5,376 games as an umpire, passing Bill Klem, whose last game was in 1941.\\n2022: Anaheim City Council votes unanimously to cancel the sale of Angel Stadium and surrounding land to Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno, following the resignation of Mayor Bill Sidhu on corruption charges a few days earlier. The $350 million sale had been agreed in December 2019 but not yet finalized, and was at the center of an FBI investigation that led to accusations that Sidhu had provided insider information to the team and in return demanded kickbacks in the form of campaign contributions. The city councillors are now no longer convinced that the proposed deal reflects the city's best interests, and are willing to risk a breach of contract lawsuit from Moreno in order to examine a potential deal again, starting from scratch.\\n\\nMay 26\\n1916: Benny Kauff of the Giants was picked off first base three times by Boston's Lefty Tyler. The miscues didn't hurt as New York won its 14th consecutive road victory beating the Braves, 12-1.\\n1925: In Detroit's 8-1 win over the Chicago White Sox, Ty Cobb became the first to collect 1,000 career extra-base hits. He finished his career with 1,139.\\n1929: Pinch-hitters Pat Crawford of the Giants and Les Bell of the Boston Braves hit grand slams in New York's 15-9 victory.\\n1930: Joe Sewell of the Cleveland Indians, who fanned only three times in 353 at-bats during the season, was struck out twice in the same game by Pat Caraway of the White Sox.\\n1937: Billy Sullivan and Bruce Campbell appeared for the Cleveland Indians as pinch hitters. Each hit a home run, making this the first time two American League pinch hitters hit home runs in the same game. The Indians beat the Athletics, 8-6.\\n1956: Cincinnati Reds pitchers John Klippstein, Hershell Freeman and Joe Black combined for 9 2-3 hitless innings, but lost 2-1 in 11 innings to the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1959: Harvey Haddix of Pittsburgh pitched 12 perfect innings before losing to Milwaukee 1-0 in the 13th on an error, a sacrifice and Joe Adcock's double.\\n1962: Sandy Koufax struck out 16 Phillies to lead the Dodgers to a 6-3 victory.\\n1969: Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hits his 500th career double, becoming only the third major leaguer to reach 500 doubles and 500 home runs.\\n1995: Southern California and Fresno State combined for an NCAA postseason baseball record of 39 runs in the Trojans' 22-17 win in the West Regional. USC scored three runs in the top of the ninth to break the record of 37 set by the Trojans and Houston in 1990.\\n1996: The Chicago White Sox became the 16th team in AL history to hit four homers in one inning in their 12-1 win over Milwaukee. Frank Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura hit consecutive homers and Chad Kreuter added another in Chicago's seven-run eighth.\\n1997: Chicago's Sammy Sosa and the Pirates' Tony Womack hit inside-the-park homers in the sixth inning of the Cubs' 2-1 win. It was the first time two inside-the-park homers had been hit in the same inning in 20 years.\\n2004: Daryle Ward hit for the cycle and tied his career best with six RBIs in Pittsburgh's 11-8 win over St. Louis.\\n2006: Derek Jeter gets his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth player in Yankees history to reach the milestone.\\n2008: Chase Utley tied the National League lead with his 16th homer and drove in six runs as Philadelphia routed Colorado 20-5. The Phillies batted around three times and had season-highs in hits (19) and runs.\\n2011: The hot-hitting Boston Red Sox routed the Detroit Tigers 14-1 in an eight-inning, rain-shortened game. The Red Sox, who beat Cleveland 14-2 the previous day, scored at least 14 runs in back-to-back games for the first time since 1998.\\n2016: Major League Baseball hands out a suspension of 82 games to Braves OF Hector Olivera, following a domestic violence incident in April. It is by far the most severe penalty yet handed out under baseball's new domestic violence policy.\\n2018: Mike Trout has the first five-hit game of his career and drives in 4 runs to lead the Angels to an 11-4 win over the Yankees.\\n2021: Commissioner Rob Manfred issues his ruling following the completion of the investigation of allegations of improper behavior towards a number of women against former manager and coach Mickey Callaway. Callaway is found guilty of violating Major League Baseball policies and is declared ineligible for the remainder of this season and all of 2022, after which he may apply for reinstatement. For their part, the Angels fire him from his position of pitching coach, from which he has been suspended since the allegations surfaced in February, and the Indians, who were Callaway's employer when some of the offensive incidents took place, state that they will take steps to ensure a more respectful environment in which employees feel empowered to denounce workplace harassement in the future.\\n2023: Craig Kimbrel becomes the eighth pitcher to record 400 career saves in Philadelphia's 6 - 4 win over the Braves, barely two weeks after Kenley Jansen became the seventh.\\n\\nSubject: Domestic violence; Breach of contract; Professional baseball; Campaign contributions; Criminal investigations\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Subject: Breach of contract\\n\\nLocation: Texas; Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Chicago Illinois; New York; United States--US; Detroit Michigan; Colorado; Los Angeles California\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: Chicago Cubs; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cleveland Indians; NAICS: 711211; Name: Philadelphia Phillies; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cincinnati Reds; NAICS: 711211; Name: Chicago White Sox; NAICS: 711211; Name: Boston Red Sox; NAICS: 711211\\n\\nTitle: ON THIS DATE\\n\\nPublication title: Chicago Tribune; Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nFirst page: 4\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 25, 2025\\n\\nSection: Sports\\n\\nPublisher: Tribune Publishing Company, LLC\\n\\nPlace of publication: Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: General Interest Periodicals--United States\\n\\nISSN: 10856706\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: News\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207346388\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/on-this-date/docview/3207346388/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright Tribune Publishing Company, LLC May 25, 2025\\n\\nLast updated: 2025-05-25\\n\\nDatabase: U.S. Newsstream Collection\",\n          \"Give President Trump the chance to banter, and he often sounds like the guy on the next bar stool, eager to opine about the game on TV. Pro football's new kickoff rule, he insists, is ruining the game. Trading NBA powerhouse Luka Doncic from the Mavericks to the Lakers was a terrible move. And Major League Baseball \\\"should get off its fat, lazy ass\\\" and finally put the Cincinnati Reds' Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame.\\nBut unlike other fans, Trump has direct lines to elite athletes and the commissioners of the major sports leagues. He has been using those connections not just to share his strong opinions but to shape his image, engage in international diplomacy and, in some cases, to intervene in America's sports establishments as he has in other major sectors of American business.\\nMany presidents have used sports as a way to relate with ordinary Americans. But Trump -- who owned a professional football team in an upstart league, hosted boxing matches at his Atlantic City casino and partners with Saudi-backed LIV Golf for events at his clubs -- is going further than his predecessors in harnessing athletics for political gain. With his talent for inserting himself into the controversy of the moment, Trump is showing that he shares the interests of millions of sports fans and is ready to express their collective grievances.\\nIn just the past few weeks, Trump discussed the four-year-old system for paying college athletes with legendary football coach Nick Saban and said afterward that he wants to rework it. He demanded that the University of Pennsylvania nullify the records of a transgender swimmer. He mused that an incentive for Russia to end the war in Ukraine could be to reverse the ban on its competing in the 2026 World Cup -- which the U.S. is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.\\nTrump met with baseball's top official to argue his case for Rose, the late All-Star player disgraced by a gambling scandal. Last week, baseball took a step toward fulfilling Trump's wish, as MLB commissioner Rob Manfred removed Rose from the list of players banned from the Hall of Fame, making him eligible to be considered for the honor.\\nIn February, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. That same month he made a splashy entrance at the Daytona 500, flying over the crowd in Air Force One and then taking a lap around the racetrack in the presidential limousine.\\n\\\"He loves to be around competitors,\\\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.), a former head coach at Auburn University who discussed the college athlete compensation system while flying with Trump earlier this month. In part Trump was concerned, Tuberville said, that the need for colleges to devote money to pay high-profile stars in the biggest collegiate sports is hurting their funding for less popular sports and women's sports -- potentially weakening U.S. medal chances in the upcoming Olympics.\\n\\\"Trump often uses sports to associate himself with winning, which has always been an obsession for him,\\\" said sports and politics historian Frederic J. Frommer. Trump has referred to the late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner as an especially close friend, Frommer notes. \\\"You can see why. They shared a win-at-all-costs mentality.\\\"\\nOn weekends Trump generally golfs at one of his clubs, often joined by professional athletes, business executives and politicians. People who have played with him say he likes to trash-talk -- and hates to lose. Golfer Tiger Woods, who has been friendly with Trump for several years, called him earlier this year to say he was dating Trump's former daughter-in-law Vanessa Trump, mother to five of the president's grandchildren. \\\"I said, 'Tiger, that's good,\\\" Trump told reporters. \\\"I'm very happy for both.\\\"\\nThis past Wednesday, when the NCAA champion University of Florida basketball team, the Gators, made a celebratory visit to the White House, Trump recapped their winning effort as if he were behind the desk at SportsCenter.\\n\\\"So, in the championship game against the Houston Cougars, what became one of the most hard-fought title games in college basketball history, the first half was a battle over every point, with both teams playing ferocious defense and the lowest-scoring first half of a championship game since 2011,\\\" Trump recounted. \\\"The Gators fell behind, and it was looking bad.\\\"\\n\\\"But in the second half, Florida stormed back with a 14 and three run,\\\" he went on. \\\"With less than 60 seconds left on the clock, Houston led by one point. Houston then fouled Alijah Martin, giving him two free throws, which he easily sank.\\\" Trump turned to Martin and asked, \\\"Were you nervous?\\\" The player shook his head no. \\\"Oh, if you didn't sink 'em, you wouldn't be up here right now,\\\" Trump said as the room burst into laughter. He then invited the team to tour the Oval Office.\\nDuring his first term, Trump famously feted Clemson University's football squad with a buffet of fast food including McDonald's Big Macs and fries. Back then, some teams boycotted Trump. In 2018, the president abruptly canceled a celebration for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles because many players said they would refuse to attend over Trump's criticism of athletes who knelt during the national anthem as a statement on racism.\\nThe Eagles won again this year, and much of the team showed up to the White House, though others, including several big stars, were still holdouts. Trump even weighed in on the controversial \\\"tush push\\\" play, where teammates shove the quarterback from behind to gain a pivotal yard or two, a tactic that the Eagles used to great success. \\\"I like it -- it's sort of exciting and different,\\\" Trump said. This week NFL owners took a vote on a proposed ban of the play, which failed.\\nWhite House guests and his audiences at public speeches often hear the president detour into the latest sports imbroglio. A new rule on kickoffs introduced by the NFL last season -- changing where players are positioned and when they can move -- has been a pet peeve for him, as for many other fans. \\\"The ball is in play, and you have two teams frozen in place, and it is the weirdest looking thing,\\\" he complained to conservative commentator Mark Levin earlier this year. He brought his opinion directly to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, privately needling him during an Oval Office event earlier this month, just before Trump announced that the NFL draft would take place on the National Mall in 2027.\\nIn some cases, Trump uses sports to signify masculinity and toughness. He has attended multiple competitions of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, one of the most violent sports on the American landscape. That instinct also appears to be behind his complaint about the kickoff-rule, which was adopted in part to reduce injuries: \\\"It's still a very violent game. And that's why people watch it. It's risky,\\\" Trump said, discussing his reasoning on a podcast co-hosted by football coach Bill Belichick. He added: \\\"You don't have to let your child play.\\\"\\nWith football fans gripped by the big surprise in this year's draft -- the unexpected shunning of the University of Colorado's Shedeur Sanders, a quarterback widely viewed as a first-round draft pick -- Trump took to social media to call team owners \\\"stupid\\\" for failing to pick him early.\\nTrump offered another hot take when his podcast hosts asked whether the explosion of sports gambling has threatened the integrity of games. \\\"Well, there will be corruption, and the only question is, will it be massive corruption, or will it be, you know, regular standard corruption?\\\" Trump ventured, before saying that it was \\\"ridiculous\\\" to keep Rose out of baseball's hall of fame because of his betting on games. \\\"You're going to have corruption. Where you have gambling, you have a lot of it,\\\" he said.\\nFar more than in his first term, Trump has used his powers to put his stamp on American culture generally, to elevate his own preferences as well as to combat institutions and ideas he deems too liberal. He promised to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of an alleged \\\"divisive, race-centered ideology\\\" that he says it used to rewrite American history. His decision to put himself forward as chairman of Washington's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts led to speculation that \\\"Memory,\\\" a favorite song of his from the musical \\\"Cats,\\\" would soon be heard on the stage.\\nBut sports have far more reach in American culture. And Trump has found ways to combine advertising his fandom with amplifying political positions that he believes favor him and his party. \\\"I love sports. I think I should have come here,\\\" he told graduates this month at the University of Alabama, before going on to condemn the participation of trans athletes in women's sports, which he banned in an executive order in February. \\\"As long as I'm president, we will always protect women's sports,\\\" he told the graduates. Men will not play in women's sports. No way.\\\"\\nTrump's immersion in sports helped him politically last year as he appeared on a series of podcasts and in other social media aimed at young men -- who ultimately swung heavily behind him in the election. With Joe Rogan, Trump talked about the value of golf for relaxation -- \\\"I was never one that could run on a treadmill\\\" -- and that, unlike in tennis, golfers of different skills can play together. A video that Trump made last summer with golf star Bryson DeChambeau has racked up 15 million views on YouTube.\\nHis courtship of sports media stars hasn't always paid off, however. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, for example, backed Trump in last year's election but has used his show to harshly criticize the president's tariff policy.\\nTrump's focus on sports has even become an element of foreign relations, beyond his golf clubs' deals with Saudi Arabia's LIV league in its challenge to the PGA Tour. Last week, while visiting the Middle East, Trump set aside time for a ceremony in which Qatar -- which also has promised Trump an airplane to use for Air Force One -- officially handed host duties over to the U.S. for next year's World Cup. The event, in which Trump and Qatar's emir signed the official soccer ball from the 2022 games, gave Trump another chance to praise his Qatari host and marvel at his palace.\\nThe U.S. will host both the World Cup and the 2028 Olympics at a time when Trump's tariffs and immigration restrictions have put it at odds with much of the world. The two events will give Trump a prestige position in sports that are followed by hundreds of millions of people around the globe. He sees drama in the fact that the U.S. will jointly host next year's soccer tournament with Canada and Mexico, two nations that have been stung by his tariffs. Asked how the trade dispute would affect the games, Trump said the tension was \\\"a good thing.\\\"\\n\\\"I think it's going to make it more exciting,\\\" he said.\\nBy Aaron Zitner and Alex Leary\\n\\nSubject: Sports fans; Bans; Athletic drafts & trades; Womens sports; Corruption; Professional baseball; Transgender persons; Athletes; Gambling; Presidents; Coaches & managers; College basketball; Scandals; Soccer; American culture; Sports rules\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Industry: 92111 :\\u200e Executive Offices 71121 :\\u200e Spectator Sports\\n\\nLocation: United States--US\\n\\nPeople: Trump, Donald J\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: National Football League--NFL; NAICS: 711211, 813990\\n\\nClassification: 92111: Executive Offices; 71121: Spectator Sports\\n\\nTitle: REVIEW --- Trump Wants to Remake The Sports World Too --- The president has strong views on everything from the NFL's kickoff rules to how college players get paid, and he's not bashful about using the power of his office to rewrite the rules of the game.\\n\\nPublication title: Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.\\n\\nFirst page: C1\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 24, 2025\\n\\nPublisher: Dow Jones & Company Inc.\\n\\nPlace of publication: New York, N.Y.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: Business And Economics--Banking And Finance\\n\\nISSN: 00999660\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: Commentary, Opinions\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207104378\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/review-trump-wants-remake-sports-world-too/docview/3207104378/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It was the first movie I saw in a theater (or in my case, a drive-in). Having grown up and regularly vacationed not that far from where it was shot, whenever I catch a snippet of \\\"Jaws\\\" on TV, even decades later, I am partly watching a film and partly seeing family photos, a childhood and home movies from New England beaches, circa 1974.\\nBoardwalk arcade games.\\nUnleashed dogs.\\nSuntan oil, not sunblock.\\nSublime lethargy, soundtracked in one scene by a beach radio that's faintly wafting Olivia Newton-John's \\\"I Honestly Love You\\\" -- although, trivia alert, in the film, it's a cover by Lynn \\\"Rose Garden\\\" Anderson, as well as a devilish example of a 28-year-old Steven Spielberg's genius for detail. Just as you hear it, the song is cued to: \\\"I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, remains uncomfortable and bittersweet, hilarious and rousing, and though Roy Scheider's sons in the film supposedly have New York accents, they sound much more working-class New England and when I hear them, I always get homesick. I catch glimpses of free-range summer vacations -- one of those sons takes a dingy into a pond, without supervision -- and mentally note coastal buildings and roads and landscapes irrevocably altered or no longer there. \\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, is more of a documentary. Every election cycle, I smile when someone posts a photo of the actor Murray Hamilton with a reminder: The mayor in \\\"Jaws\\\" is still mayor in \\\"Jaws 2.\\\"\\nThat said, from Cape Cod to saltwater-free Chicago, perhaps for you, the response was just as primal: \\\"Jaws\\\" inaugurated the lifelong feeling that something's down there, beneath us in the water, wherever we were swimming, even if we were wading in a neighbor's aboveground pool.\\nMy daughter once eye-rolled me, suspicious at my claim that \\\"Jaws\\\" kept people out of the water for years, regardless of whether that body of water was the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Michigan or a backyard swimming pool. I assured her, there's good reason Universal Pictures decided the tagline for \\\"Jaws 2\\\" needed to be: \\\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...\\\" There's even a clinical name for the phobia that \\\"Jaws\\\" appeared to exacerbate among a population who probably didn't know they had it to begin with: Thalassophobia, or the intense foreboding one feels around deep water and whatever exists under the surface.\\nAsk a film critic and they will confirm, regardless of whether they agree: \\\"Jaws\\\" gets routinely name-checked as one of the few perfect movies in the entire history of cinema, a movie so much about its own medium that in 1975 Pauline Kael wrote of running into a veteran director who was astonished by the young upstart director of \\\"Jaws.\\\" The filmmaker said that Spielberg \\\"must never have seen a play. He's the first one of us who doesn't think in terms of the proscenium arch. ... There's nothing but the camera lens.\\\"\\nHere's how that translated inside a theater: Audiences floated at the lip of the ocean, the waves casually slapping at the bottom of movie screens, reminding them, without spelling it out, that something's below. Here's how it translated after we left the theater: A horror flick irrevocably changed our relationship to swimming. Hitchcock's \\\"Psycho\\\" spoiled the long hot shower for a few years, but Spielberg ruined 70% of the Earth's surface.\\nA few weeks after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, a columnist at this newspaper, taking this temperature of alarm, reminded readers they had a better chance of being struck by lightning than being eaten by sharks. Besides, the (true-ish) story Quint tells in the film about the hundreds of soldiers killed by sharks after the U.S.S. Indianapolis sank -- an exaggeration. It wasn't hundreds, it was \\\"70 or 80 at most.\\\" Whew. A few months after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, the fear remained so real that another columnist noted: \\\"The silver screen knoweth no salt-water boundaries. Somewhere in the country, a swimmer may well be looking for a fin in his chlorinated pool at this very moment.\\\" Grabbing the feet of fellow swimmers had become a thing. Humming \\\"DunDunDunDUNDUN\\\" was already a cliche.\\nAsked by a reporter that summer if \\\"Jaws\\\" had already become indelible, Roy Scheider could not have answered more wrongly: \\\"Traumatic shocks in entertainment disappear.\\\"\\nSorry, Chief Brody, but for years afterward, reporters and editors at this paper received the occasional letter or phone call, from tourists testing Oak Street Beach, from visiting suburbanites, seeking reassurance, or just wondering: Could Lake Michigan contain a shark or two? Philip Willink, a researcher for the Illinois Natural History Survey, former senior biologist at Shedd Aquarium and co-author of the new \\\"Fishes of the Chicago Region: A Field Guide,\\\" remembers the movie creating \\\"all kinds of problems for regional fish biologists. I used to routinely get calls from concerned parents wondering if it was safe to let their kids swim at Chicago beaches -- or was there a risk of shark attack.\\\"\\nThere was not.\\nStill, the other day I spotted a bumper sticker: \\\"The Great Lakes: Unsalted and Shark Free.\\\" As Henry David Thoreau once wrote presciently: \\\"I have no doubt that one shark in a dozen years is enough to keep the reputation of a beach a hundred miles long.\\\"\\nRumors are pesky creatures: The big one that got going after \\\"Jaws\\\" was an urban legend about a boy named George Lawson who, depending on who told it, lost a leg to a shark in Lake Michigan or was eaten and never found. This did not happen. But what did was at least one hoax, as well as an incident biologists still debate. The hoax: In spring 1969, two fishermen pulled up a dead 29-inch-long shark off Milwaukee. After their catch created a bout of agita along Lake Michigan, a Wisconsin tavern owner admitted he had snagged a shark off Florida in 1967, and, for reasons lost to history, kept it in a refrigerator, presumably biding time until his killer prank. As recently as 2008, a dead two-foot-long blacktip shark was found near Traverse City, Michigan -- again, it was probably imported and then dumped, or so says the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\\nLess clear-cut is what happened in 1937 on the Mississippi River in Alton, Illinois: Though sharks are largely a saltwater species, fishermen working along the Missouri line pulled up a five-foot-long bull shark. Photographic evidence points to a bull; researchers at the time confirmed, yes, it's a bull. But just last year, a piece in the Detroit Free-Press described biologists as still split on whether that catch was just another hoax or, more likely, a terrific example of the adaptability of the bull shark.\\nLook, don't listen to me, try a professional fish man: Kevin Feldheim of the Field Museum, whose work focuses on the biology of sharks, said: \\\"Some sharks -- bulls in particular -- can tolerate fresh water and do swim quite far up rivers.\\\" Bulls are special. But he's never heard of a bull navigating fresh water as far north as a Great Lake. However, as a child in the Los Angeles suburbs, he did get interested in sharks because of \\\"Jaws.\\\" It never affected whether or not he swam in pools.\\n\\\"Although the movie 'Piranha' did.\\\"\\nConsidering that 1978's \\\"Piranha\\\" -- directed by a young Joe Dante and written by a young John Sayles -- was one of the first successful \\\"Jaws\\\" rip-offs, I believe this is splitting hairs. Irrational fear is not different from the panic sweeping beaches in \\\"Jaws.\\\"\\nThere's truth involved: When I was a kid, a friend whose home stood on stilts alongside a cove on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay -- which does see the occasional great white shark -- was convinced a great white ate his dog. In truth, it was likely a mako. Whew, again.\\nBut also, there's more perception than reality. Another friend of mine, an NCAA swimmer back in college, often finds herself in a freshwater lake in New York: \\\"When I am doing a long swim across the lake, I often think of the (\\\"Jaws\\\") poster and get myself all anxious.\\\" Brian Samuels, a Deerfield native and fishmonger at Dirk's Fish in Lincoln Park, informed me: \\\"I would not swim in public pools because of ('Jaws'). Not just that, but across the street from my house, a neighbor had a pool and I was convinced, beneath me in that dark water, there was a shark, because, of course, there had to be.\\\"\\nEven Gene Pokorny, principal tubaist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra -- who has played the infamously ominous tuba thumps in the \\\"Jaws\\\" score at Ravinia Festival while conducted by John Williams, its Oscar-winning composer -- does not swim in deep bodies of water, period. He always thinks of \\\"the guys from the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\\\" He also thinks of Tommy Johnson, his late friend and teacher, who played the tuba on the \\\"Jaws\\\" soundtrack. In fact, Pokorny was there at the recording:\\n\\\"I remember it clearly and I remember the circumstances were horrendous. I was there with three friends from the University of Southern California and we had managed to get permission to watch. I was in my last quarter of college at the time. We didn't really know anything about the film itself, but I remember (the recording session) was late in starting because Tommy, my tuba teacher, was also a regular instructor at a high school and it was rainy that day and the substitute who was coming to fill in for him was late. Plus, there's the traffic in LA. So everyone is already there waiting when Tommy comes crashing in. The whole orchestra is waiting. Tommy makes his way toward the back row and John Williams just goes, 'ARE you ready?' Tommy says 'Sure,' pulls out the music, looks at it, the red light goes on to record. He did it cold. There was a movie screen in the studio set to that first scene in the movie, with the woman swimming at night in the ocean. Tommy did not even have the right tuba that day, but the double bassists came in and he nailed it perfectly. It's what you hear in the movie, one of the most remarkable things. He played tuba on tens of thousands of film and TV scores, but this became his claim to fame. I remember thinking how the images on screen were perfectly complemented by this music. I remember watching with my mouth wide open.\\\"\\nI can think of no better illustration of the power \\\"Jaws\\\" that retains: Pokorny was present while its Hollywood mythology was being crafted, and he still can not swim in an ocean.\\nAs biologists have noted over the past 50 years, sharks ironically became the true victims of \\\"Jaws,\\\" villainized and exploited by industries that lobbed off fins for food. The upside is that sharks also became symbols of ocean conservation -- a cause that \\\"Jaws\\\" author Peter Benchley espoused during the last years of his life, before he died in 2006.\\nIn case you're wondering, the Florida-based International Shark Attack File says that, since 1975, less than 60 people have been killed by great white sharks, worldwide. Not one of those people was swimming in Lake Michigan. According to the Coast Guard's Great Lakes offices in Cleveland, shark sightings across the Midwest are now basically zilch.\\nStill, Willink, of the Illinois Natural History Survey, said he was vacationing last year on the South Carolina coast when he noticed a fin slice the ocean surface, not far from his son. They had recently watched the film for the first time, and though his son showed no fear of swimming in oceans, Willink's heart jumped into his throat. The scene in which a mother \\\"is wandering hopelessly and in grief along the surf is seared in my memory.\\\"\\nThat fin belonged to a bottlenose dolphin.\\n\\\"But my first thought was the movie 'Jaws.' \\\"\\n\\nThe Music Box hosts a 50th anniversary screening of \\\"Jaws\\\" in 35mm at 9 p.m. May 26; musicboxtheatre.com.

Ruth connected once off Red Lucas and twice off Guy Bush.\\n1941: Boston's Ted Williams raised his batting average over .400 for the first time during the season. Williams finished the season batting. 406.\\n1951: Willie Mays, a highly touted rookie for the Giants, went 0-for-5 in his debut against the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1982: Ferguson Jenkins became the seventh pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters in the Chicago Cubs' 2-1 loss at San Diego. Jenkins reached the milestone by striking out Garry Templeton in the third inning.\\n2001: Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs allowed one hit and struck out 14 in a 1-0 win over the Brewers. Wood took a no-hit bid into the seventh before giving up a leadoff single to Mark Loretta.\\n2001: Hideo Nomo of the Boston Red Sox tossed a one-hitter and struck out 14 in a 4-0 win over Toronto. Nomo faced one batter over the minimum of 27, giving up a leadoff double in the\\nfourth to Shannon Stewart.\\n2002: Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers homered twice in a 10-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, setting a major league record with seven homers in his last three games.\\n2005: The St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-1, in 12 innings, as manager Tony La Russa wins his 823rd game with the Cardinals, passing Whitey Herzog for second place on the franchise list. La Russa is 218 victories behind Cardinals leader Red Schoendienst.\\n2009: Jim Thome passes Mike Schmidt for 13th on the all-time home run list, as the White Sox thump the Angels, 17-3.\\n2011: Andruw Jones hit a pair of two-run homers, Mark Teixeira also hit a two-run shot and Mariano Rivera made a milestone appearance in New York's 7-3 victory over Toronto. Rivera pitched the ninth inning in a non-save situation, the 1,000th game he's played for the Yankees. The 11-time All-Star closer became the first player in major league history to reach the plateau for one team and the 15th to make it overall. Jones homered in the second inning and Teixeira in the third off Jo-Jo Reyes, who matched a major league record by making his 28th consecutive start without a win.\\n2011: Infielder Wilson Valdez wound up as the winning pitcher when the Philadelphia Phillies needed 19 innings to outlast the Cincinnati Reds 5-4. Valdez threw a hitless 19th inning in his first professional pitching appearance. He became the first position player to become a winning pitcher since Colorado catcher Brent Mayne on Aug. 22, 2000.\\n2012: Nelson Cruz hit a grand slam and tied his career high with eight RBIs, Josh Hamilton hit his 19th home run of the season and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 14-3. Cruz's grand slam came in the seventh inning and gave Texas a 14-1 lead. He also had a three-run double in the first and an RBI single in the sixth.\\n2013: Angel Pagan became the first San Francisco player to end a game with an inside-the-park homer, connecting with a runner aboard in the bottom of the 10th inning to give the Giants a 6-5 victory over Colorado. The last major leaguer to hit an inside-the-park home run that ended a game was Rey Sanchez for Tampa Bay on June 11, 2004 -- also in a 10-inning victory over Colorado.\\n2014: Josh Beckett of the Dodgers records the first no-hitter of the year by blanking the Phillies, 6-0. It is the first no-hitter by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo pitched one in 1996, and the first nine-inning no-hitter by an opposing pitcher in Philadelphia since Bill Stoneman of the Montreal Expos back in 1969.\\n2019: The Padres set a franchise record with 7 homers in a 19-4 win over the Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre. Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe hit two each while Austin Hedges blasts a grand slam off Edwin Jackson. Cal Quantrill is the beneficiary of this power display as he records his first career victory a short distance from his hometown of Port Hope, ON, while another local boy, Josh Naylor from Mississauga, ON, collects his first three big league hits for the Padres in the game.\\n2021: By working home plate in a game between the Cardinals and White Sox, Joe West sets a new career record with 5,376 games as an umpire, passing Bill Klem, whose last game was in 1941.\\n2022: Anaheim City Council votes unanimously to cancel the sale of Angel Stadium and surrounding land to Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno, following the resignation of Mayor Bill Sidhu on corruption charges a few days earlier. The $350 million sale had been agreed in December 2019 but not yet finalized, and was at the center of an FBI investigation that led to accusations that Sidhu had provided insider information to the team and in return demanded kickbacks in the form of campaign contributions. The city councillors are now no longer convinced that the proposed deal reflects the city's best interests, and are willing to risk a breach of contract lawsuit from Moreno in order to examine a potential deal again, starting from scratch.\\n\\nMay 26\\n1916: Benny Kauff of the Giants was picked off first base three times by Boston's Lefty Tyler. The miscues didn't hurt as New York won its 14th consecutive road victory beating the Braves, 12-1.\\n1925: In Detroit's 8-1 win over the Chicago White Sox, Ty Cobb became the first to collect 1,000 career extra-base hits. He finished his career with 1,139.\\n1929: Pinch-hitters Pat Crawford of the Giants and Les Bell of the Boston Braves hit grand slams in New York's 15-9 victory.\\n1930: Joe Sewell of the Cleveland Indians, who fanned only three times in 353 at-bats during the season, was struck out twice in the same game by Pat Caraway of the White Sox.\\n1937: Billy Sullivan and Bruce Campbell appeared for the Cleveland Indians as pinch hitters. Each hit a home run, making this the first time two American League pinch hitters hit home runs in the same game. The Indians beat the Athletics, 8-6.\\n1956: Cincinnati Reds pitchers John Klippstein, Hershell Freeman and Joe Black combined for 9 2-3 hitless innings, but lost 2-1 in 11 innings to the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n1959: Harvey Haddix of Pittsburgh pitched 12 perfect innings before losing to Milwaukee 1-0 in the 13th on an error, a sacrifice and Joe Adcock's double.\\n1962: Sandy Koufax struck out 16 Phillies to lead the Dodgers to a 6-3 victory.\\n1969: Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hits his 500th career double, becoming only the third major leaguer to reach 500 doubles and 500 home runs.\\n1995: Southern California and Fresno State combined for an NCAA postseason baseball record of 39 runs in the Trojans' 22-17 win in the West Regional. USC scored three runs in the top of the ninth to break the record of 37 set by the Trojans and Houston in 1990.\\n1996: The Chicago White Sox became the 16th team in AL history to hit four homers in one inning in their 12-1 win over Milwaukee. Frank Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura hit consecutive homers and Chad Kreuter added another in Chicago's seven-run eighth.\\n1997: Chicago's Sammy Sosa and the Pirates' Tony Womack hit inside-the-park homers in the sixth inning of the Cubs' 2-1 win. It was the first time two inside-the-park homers had been hit in the same inning in 20 years.\\n2004: Daryle Ward hit for the cycle and tied his career best with six RBIs in Pittsburgh's 11-8 win over St. Louis.\\n2006: Derek Jeter gets his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth player in Yankees history to reach the milestone.\\n2008: Chase Utley tied the National League lead with his 16th homer and drove in six runs as Philadelphia routed Colorado 20-5. The Phillies batted around three times and had season-highs in hits (19) and runs.\\n2011: The hot-hitting Boston Red Sox routed the Detroit Tigers 14-1 in an eight-inning, rain-shortened game. The Red Sox, who beat Cleveland 14-2 the previous day, scored at least 14 runs in back-to-back games for the first time since 1998.\\n2016: Major League Baseball hands out a suspension of 82 games to Braves OF Hector Olivera, following a domestic violence incident in April. It is by far the most severe penalty yet handed out under baseball's new domestic violence policy.\\n2018: Mike Trout has the first five-hit game of his career and drives in 4 runs to lead the Angels to an 11-4 win over the Yankees.\\n2021: Commissioner Rob Manfred issues his ruling following the completion of the investigation of allegations of improper behavior towards a number of women against former manager and coach Mickey Callaway. Callaway is found guilty of violating Major League Baseball policies and is declared ineligible for the remainder of this season and all of 2022, after which he may apply for reinstatement. For their part, the Angels fire him from his position of pitching coach, from which he has been suspended since the allegations surfaced in February, and the Indians, who were Callaway's employer when some of the offensive incidents took place, state that they will take steps to ensure a more respectful environment in which employees feel empowered to denounce workplace harassement in the future.\\n2023: Craig Kimbrel becomes the eighth pitcher to record 400 career saves in Philadelphia's 6 - 4 win over the Braves, barely two weeks after Kenley Jansen became the seventh.\\n\\nSubject: Domestic violence; Breach of contract; Professional baseball; Campaign contributions; Criminal investigations\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Subject: Breach of contract\\n\\nLocation: Texas; Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Chicago Illinois; New York; United States--US; Detroit Michigan; Colorado; Los Angeles California\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: Chicago Cubs; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cleveland Indians; NAICS: 711211; Name: Philadelphia Phillies; NAICS: 711211; Name: Cincinnati Reds; NAICS: 711211; Name: Chicago White Sox; NAICS: 711211; Name: Boston Red Sox; NAICS: 711211\\n\\nTitle: ON THIS DATE\\n\\nPublication title: Chicago Tribune; Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nFirst page: 4\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 25, 2025\\n\\nSection: Sports\\n\\nPublisher: Tribune Publishing Company, LLC\\n\\nPlace of publication: Chicago, Ill.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: General Interest Periodicals--United States\\n\\nISSN: 10856706\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: News\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207346388\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/on-this-date/docview/3207346388/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright Tribune Publishing Company, LLC May 25, 2025\\n\\nLast updated: 2025-05-25\\n\\nDatabase: U.S. Newsstream Collection\",\n          \"Give President Trump the chance to banter, and he often sounds like the guy on the next bar stool, eager to opine about the game on TV. Pro football's new kickoff rule, he insists, is ruining the game. Trading NBA powerhouse Luka Doncic from the Mavericks to the Lakers was a terrible move. And Major League Baseball \\\"should get off its fat, lazy ass\\\" and finally put the Cincinnati Reds' Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame.\\nBut unlike other fans, Trump has direct lines to elite athletes and the commissioners of the major sports leagues. He has been using those connections not just to share his strong opinions but to shape his image, engage in international diplomacy and, in some cases, to intervene in America's sports establishments as he has in other major sectors of American business.\\nMany presidents have used sports as a way to relate with ordinary Americans. But Trump -- who owned a professional football team in an upstart league, hosted boxing matches at his Atlantic City casino and partners with Saudi-backed LIV Golf for events at his clubs -- is going further than his predecessors in harnessing athletics for political gain. With his talent for inserting himself into the controversy of the moment, Trump is showing that he shares the interests of millions of sports fans and is ready to express their collective grievances.\\nIn just the past few weeks, Trump discussed the four-year-old system for paying college athletes with legendary football coach Nick Saban and said afterward that he wants to rework it. He demanded that the University of Pennsylvania nullify the records of a transgender swimmer. He mused that an incentive for Russia to end the war in Ukraine could be to reverse the ban on its competing in the 2026 World Cup -- which the U.S. is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.\\nTrump met with baseball's top official to argue his case for Rose, the late All-Star player disgraced by a gambling scandal. Last week, baseball took a step toward fulfilling Trump's wish, as MLB commissioner Rob Manfred removed Rose from the list of players banned from the Hall of Fame, making him eligible to be considered for the honor.\\nIn February, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. That same month he made a splashy entrance at the Daytona 500, flying over the crowd in Air Force One and then taking a lap around the racetrack in the presidential limousine.\\n\\\"He loves to be around competitors,\\\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.), a former head coach at Auburn University who discussed the college athlete compensation system while flying with Trump earlier this month. In part Trump was concerned, Tuberville said, that the need for colleges to devote money to pay high-profile stars in the biggest collegiate sports is hurting their funding for less popular sports and women's sports -- potentially weakening U.S. medal chances in the upcoming Olympics.\\n\\\"Trump often uses sports to associate himself with winning, which has always been an obsession for him,\\\" said sports and politics historian Frederic J. Frommer. Trump has referred to the late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner as an especially close friend, Frommer notes. \\\"You can see why. They shared a win-at-all-costs mentality.\\\"\\nOn weekends Trump generally golfs at one of his clubs, often joined by professional athletes, business executives and politicians. People who have played with him say he likes to trash-talk -- and hates to lose. Golfer Tiger Woods, who has been friendly with Trump for several years, called him earlier this year to say he was dating Trump's former daughter-in-law Vanessa Trump, mother to five of the president's grandchildren. \\\"I said, 'Tiger, that's good,\\\" Trump told reporters. \\\"I'm very happy for both.\\\"\\nThis past Wednesday, when the NCAA champion University of Florida basketball team, the Gators, made a celebratory visit to the White House, Trump recapped their winning effort as if he were behind the desk at SportsCenter.\\n\\\"So, in the championship game against the Houston Cougars, what became one of the most hard-fought title games in college basketball history, the first half was a battle over every point, with both teams playing ferocious defense and the lowest-scoring first half of a championship game since 2011,\\\" Trump recounted. \\\"The Gators fell behind, and it was looking bad.\\\"\\n\\\"But in the second half, Florida stormed back with a 14 and three run,\\\" he went on. \\\"With less than 60 seconds left on the clock, Houston led by one point. Houston then fouled Alijah Martin, giving him two free throws, which he easily sank.\\\" Trump turned to Martin and asked, \\\"Were you nervous?\\\" The player shook his head no. \\\"Oh, if you didn't sink 'em, you wouldn't be up here right now,\\\" Trump said as the room burst into laughter. He then invited the team to tour the Oval Office.\\nDuring his first term, Trump famously feted Clemson University's football squad with a buffet of fast food including McDonald's Big Macs and fries. Back then, some teams boycotted Trump. In 2018, the president abruptly canceled a celebration for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles because many players said they would refuse to attend over Trump's criticism of athletes who knelt during the national anthem as a statement on racism.\\nThe Eagles won again this year, and much of the team showed up to the White House, though others, including several big stars, were still holdouts. Trump even weighed in on the controversial \\\"tush push\\\" play, where teammates shove the quarterback from behind to gain a pivotal yard or two, a tactic that the Eagles used to great success. \\\"I like it -- it's sort of exciting and different,\\\" Trump said. This week NFL owners took a vote on a proposed ban of the play, which failed.\\nWhite House guests and his audiences at public speeches often hear the president detour into the latest sports imbroglio. A new rule on kickoffs introduced by the NFL last season -- changing where players are positioned and when they can move -- has been a pet peeve for him, as for many other fans. \\\"The ball is in play, and you have two teams frozen in place, and it is the weirdest looking thing,\\\" he complained to conservative commentator Mark Levin earlier this year. He brought his opinion directly to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, privately needling him during an Oval Office event earlier this month, just before Trump announced that the NFL draft would take place on the National Mall in 2027.\\nIn some cases, Trump uses sports to signify masculinity and toughness. He has attended multiple competitions of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, one of the most violent sports on the American landscape. That instinct also appears to be behind his complaint about the kickoff-rule, which was adopted in part to reduce injuries: \\\"It's still a very violent game. And that's why people watch it. It's risky,\\\" Trump said, discussing his reasoning on a podcast co-hosted by football coach Bill Belichick. He added: \\\"You don't have to let your child play.\\\"\\nWith football fans gripped by the big surprise in this year's draft -- the unexpected shunning of the University of Colorado's Shedeur Sanders, a quarterback widely viewed as a first-round draft pick -- Trump took to social media to call team owners \\\"stupid\\\" for failing to pick him early.\\nTrump offered another hot take when his podcast hosts asked whether the explosion of sports gambling has threatened the integrity of games. \\\"Well, there will be corruption, and the only question is, will it be massive corruption, or will it be, you know, regular standard corruption?\\\" Trump ventured, before saying that it was \\\"ridiculous\\\" to keep Rose out of baseball's hall of fame because of his betting on games. \\\"You're going to have corruption. Where you have gambling, you have a lot of it,\\\" he said.\\nFar more than in his first term, Trump has used his powers to put his stamp on American culture generally, to elevate his own preferences as well as to combat institutions and ideas he deems too liberal. He promised to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of an alleged \\\"divisive, race-centered ideology\\\" that he says it used to rewrite American history. His decision to put himself forward as chairman of Washington's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts led to speculation that \\\"Memory,\\\" a favorite song of his from the musical \\\"Cats,\\\" would soon be heard on the stage.\\nBut sports have far more reach in American culture. And Trump has found ways to combine advertising his fandom with amplifying political positions that he believes favor him and his party. \\\"I love sports. I think I should have come here,\\\" he told graduates this month at the University of Alabama, before going on to condemn the participation of trans athletes in women's sports, which he banned in an executive order in February. \\\"As long as I'm president, we will always protect women's sports,\\\" he told the graduates. Men will not play in women's sports. No way.\\\"\\nTrump's immersion in sports helped him politically last year as he appeared on a series of podcasts and in other social media aimed at young men -- who ultimately swung heavily behind him in the election. With Joe Rogan, Trump talked about the value of golf for relaxation -- \\\"I was never one that could run on a treadmill\\\" -- and that, unlike in tennis, golfers of different skills can play together. A video that Trump made last summer with golf star Bryson DeChambeau has racked up 15 million views on YouTube.\\nHis courtship of sports media stars hasn't always paid off, however. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, for example, backed Trump in last year's election but has used his show to harshly criticize the president's tariff policy.\\nTrump's focus on sports has even become an element of foreign relations, beyond his golf clubs' deals with Saudi Arabia's LIV league in its challenge to the PGA Tour. Last week, while visiting the Middle East, Trump set aside time for a ceremony in which Qatar -- which also has promised Trump an airplane to use for Air Force One -- officially handed host duties over to the U.S. for next year's World Cup. The event, in which Trump and Qatar's emir signed the official soccer ball from the 2022 games, gave Trump another chance to praise his Qatari host and marvel at his palace.\\nThe U.S. will host both the World Cup and the 2028 Olympics at a time when Trump's tariffs and immigration restrictions have put it at odds with much of the world. The two events will give Trump a prestige position in sports that are followed by hundreds of millions of people around the globe. He sees drama in the fact that the U.S. will jointly host next year's soccer tournament with Canada and Mexico, two nations that have been stung by his tariffs. Asked how the trade dispute would affect the games, Trump said the tension was \\\"a good thing.\\\"\\n\\\"I think it's going to make it more exciting,\\\" he said.\\nBy Aaron Zitner and Alex Leary\\n\\nSubject: Sports fans; Bans; Athletic drafts & trades; Womens sports; Corruption; Professional baseball; Transgender persons; Athletes; Gambling; Presidents; Coaches & managers; College basketball; Scandals; Soccer; American culture; Sports rules\\n\\nBusiness indexing term: Industry: 92111 :\\u200e Executive Offices 71121 :\\u200e Spectator Sports\\n\\nLocation: United States--US\\n\\nPeople: Trump, Donald J\\n\\nCompany / organization: Name: National Football League--NFL; NAICS: 711211, 813990\\n\\nClassification: 92111: Executive Offices; 71121: Spectator Sports\\n\\nTitle: REVIEW --- Trump Wants to Remake The Sports World Too --- The president has strong views on everything from the NFL's kickoff rules to how college players get paid, and he's not bashful about using the power of his office to rewrite the rules of the game.\\n\\nPublication title: Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.\\n\\nFirst page: C1\\n\\nPublication year: 2025\\n\\nPublication date: May 24, 2025\\n\\nPublisher: Dow Jones & Company Inc.\\n\\nPlace of publication: New York, N.Y.\\n\\nCountry of publication: United States\\n\\nPublication subject: Business And Economics--Banking And Finance\\n\\nISSN: 00999660\\n\\nSource type: Newspaper\\n\\nLanguage of publication: English\\n\\nDocument type: Commentary, Opinions\\n\\nProQuest document ID: 3207104378\\n\\nDocument URL: http://ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/usnews/newspapers/review-trump-wants-remake-sports-world-too/docview/3207104378/sem-2?accountid=10499\\n\\nCopyright: Copyright 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Having grown up and regularly vacationed not that far from where it was shot, whenever I catch a snippet of \\\"Jaws\\\" on TV, even decades later, I am partly watching a film and partly seeing family photos, a childhood and home movies from New England beaches, circa 1974.\\nBoardwalk arcade games.\\nUnleashed dogs.\\nSuntan oil, not sunblock.\\nSublime lethargy, soundtracked in one scene by a beach radio that's faintly wafting Olivia Newton-John's \\\"I Honestly Love You\\\" -- although, trivia alert, in the film, it's a cover by Lynn \\\"Rose Garden\\\" Anderson, as well as a devilish example of a 28-year-old Steven Spielberg's genius for detail. Just as you hear it, the song is cued to: \\\"I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, remains uncomfortable and bittersweet, hilarious and rousing, and though Roy Scheider's sons in the film supposedly have New York accents, they sound much more working-class New England and when I hear them, I always get homesick. I catch glimpses of free-range summer vacations -- one of those sons takes a dingy into a pond, without supervision -- and mentally note coastal buildings and roads and landscapes irrevocably altered or no longer there. \\\"Jaws,\\\" for me, is more of a documentary. Every election cycle, I smile when someone posts a photo of the actor Murray Hamilton with a reminder: The mayor in \\\"Jaws\\\" is still mayor in \\\"Jaws 2.\\\"\\nThat said, from Cape Cod to saltwater-free Chicago, perhaps for you, the response was just as primal: \\\"Jaws\\\" inaugurated the lifelong feeling that something's down there, beneath us in the water, wherever we were swimming, even if we were wading in a neighbor's aboveground pool.\\nMy daughter once eye-rolled me, suspicious at my claim that \\\"Jaws\\\" kept people out of the water for years, regardless of whether that body of water was the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Michigan or a backyard swimming pool. I assured her, there's good reason Universal Pictures decided the tagline for \\\"Jaws 2\\\" needed to be: \\\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...\\\" There's even a clinical name for the phobia that \\\"Jaws\\\" appeared to exacerbate among a population who probably didn't know they had it to begin with: Thalassophobia, or the intense foreboding one feels around deep water and whatever exists under the surface.\\nAsk a film critic and they will confirm, regardless of whether they agree: \\\"Jaws\\\" gets routinely name-checked as one of the few perfect movies in the entire history of cinema, a movie so much about its own medium that in 1975 Pauline Kael wrote of running into a veteran director who was astonished by the young upstart director of \\\"Jaws.\\\" The filmmaker said that Spielberg \\\"must never have seen a play. He's the first one of us who doesn't think in terms of the proscenium arch. ... There's nothing but the camera lens.\\\"\\nHere's how that translated inside a theater: Audiences floated at the lip of the ocean, the waves casually slapping at the bottom of movie screens, reminding them, without spelling it out, that something's below. Here's how it translated after we left the theater: A horror flick irrevocably changed our relationship to swimming. Hitchcock's \\\"Psycho\\\" spoiled the long hot shower for a few years, but Spielberg ruined 70% of the Earth's surface.\\nA few weeks after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, a columnist at this newspaper, taking this temperature of alarm, reminded readers they had a better chance of being struck by lightning than being eaten by sharks. Besides, the (true-ish) story Quint tells in the film about the hundreds of soldiers killed by sharks after the U.S.S. Indianapolis sank -- an exaggeration. It wasn't hundreds, it was \\\"70 or 80 at most.\\\" Whew. A few months after \\\"Jaws\\\" opened, the fear remained so real that another columnist noted: \\\"The silver screen knoweth no salt-water boundaries. Somewhere in the country, a swimmer may well be looking for a fin in his chlorinated pool at this very moment.\\\" Grabbing the feet of fellow swimmers had become a thing. Humming \\\"DunDunDunDUNDUN\\\" was already a cliche.\\nAsked by a reporter that summer if \\\"Jaws\\\" had already become indelible, Roy Scheider could not have answered more wrongly: \\\"Traumatic shocks in entertainment disappear.\\\"\\nSorry, Chief Brody, but for years afterward, reporters and editors at this paper received the occasional letter or phone call, from tourists testing Oak Street Beach, from visiting suburbanites, seeking reassurance, or just wondering: Could Lake Michigan contain a shark or two? Philip Willink, a researcher for the Illinois Natural History Survey, former senior biologist at Shedd Aquarium and co-author of the new \\\"Fishes of the Chicago Region: A Field Guide,\\\" remembers the movie creating \\\"all kinds of problems for regional fish biologists. I used to routinely get calls from concerned parents wondering if it was safe to let their kids swim at Chicago beaches -- or was there a risk of shark attack.\\\"\\nThere was not.\\nStill, the other day I spotted a bumper sticker: \\\"The Great Lakes: Unsalted and Shark Free.\\\" As Henry David Thoreau once wrote presciently: \\\"I have no doubt that one shark in a dozen years is enough to keep the reputation of a beach a hundred miles long.\\\"\\nRumors are pesky creatures: The big one that got going after \\\"Jaws\\\" was an urban legend about a boy named George Lawson who, depending on who told it, lost a leg to a shark in Lake Michigan or was eaten and never found. This did not happen. But what did was at least one hoax, as well as an incident biologists still debate. The hoax: In spring 1969, two fishermen pulled up a dead 29-inch-long shark off Milwaukee. After their catch created a bout of agita along Lake Michigan, a Wisconsin tavern owner admitted he had snagged a shark off Florida in 1967, and, for reasons lost to history, kept it in a refrigerator, presumably biding time until his killer prank. As recently as 2008, a dead two-foot-long blacktip shark was found near Traverse City, Michigan -- again, it was probably imported and then dumped, or so says the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\\nLess clear-cut is what happened in 1937 on the Mississippi River in Alton, Illinois: Though sharks are largely a saltwater species, fishermen working along the Missouri line pulled up a five-foot-long bull shark. Photographic evidence points to a bull; researchers at the time confirmed, yes, it's a bull. But just last year, a piece in the Detroit Free-Press described biologists as still split on whether that catch was just another hoax or, more likely, a terrific example of the adaptability of the bull shark.\\nLook, don't listen to me, try a professional fish man: Kevin Feldheim of the Field Museum, whose work focuses on the biology of sharks, said: \\\"Some sharks -- bulls in particular -- can tolerate fresh water and do swim quite far up rivers.\\\" Bulls are special. But he's never heard of a bull navigating fresh water as far north as a Great Lake. However, as a child in the Los Angeles suburbs, he did get interested in sharks because of \\\"Jaws.\\\" It never affected whether or not he swam in pools.\\n\\\"Although the movie 'Piranha' did.\\\"\\nConsidering that 1978's \\\"Piranha\\\" -- directed by a young Joe Dante and written by a young John Sayles -- was one of the first successful \\\"Jaws\\\" rip-offs, I believe this is splitting hairs. Irrational fear is not different from the panic sweeping beaches in \\\"Jaws.\\\"\\nThere's truth involved: When I was a kid, a friend whose home stood on stilts alongside a cove on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay -- which does see the occasional great white shark -- was convinced a great white ate his dog. In truth, it was likely a mako. Whew, again.\\nBut also, there's more perception than reality. Another friend of mine, an NCAA swimmer back in college, often finds herself in a freshwater lake in New York: \\\"When I am doing a long swim across the lake, I often think of the (\\\"Jaws\\\") poster and get myself all anxious.\\\" Brian Samuels, a Deerfield native and fishmonger at Dirk's Fish in Lincoln Park, informed me: \\\"I would not swim in public pools because of ('Jaws'). Not just that, but across the street from my house, a neighbor had a pool and I was convinced, beneath me in that dark water, there was a shark, because, of course, there had to be.\\\"\\nEven Gene Pokorny, principal tubaist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra -- who has played the infamously ominous tuba thumps in the \\\"Jaws\\\" score at Ravinia Festival while conducted by John Williams, its Oscar-winning composer -- does not swim in deep bodies of water, period. He always thinks of \\\"the guys from the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\\\" He also thinks of Tommy Johnson, his late friend and teacher, who played the tuba on the \\\"Jaws\\\" soundtrack. In fact, Pokorny was there at the recording:\\n\\\"I remember it clearly and I remember the circumstances were horrendous. I was there with three friends from the University of Southern California and we had managed to get permission to watch. I was in my last quarter of college at the time. We didn't really know anything about the film itself, but I remember (the recording session) was late in starting because Tommy, my tuba teacher, was also a regular instructor at a high school and it was rainy that day and the substitute who was coming to fill in for him was late. Plus, there's the traffic in LA. So everyone is already there waiting when Tommy comes crashing in. The whole orchestra is waiting. Tommy makes his way toward the back row and John Williams just goes, 'ARE you ready?' Tommy says 'Sure,' pulls out the music, looks at it, the red light goes on to record. He did it cold. There was a movie screen in the studio set to that first scene in the movie, with the woman swimming at night in the ocean. Tommy did not even have the right tuba that day, but the double bassists came in and he nailed it perfectly. It's what you hear in the movie, one of the most remarkable things. He played tuba on tens of thousands of film and TV scores, but this became his claim to fame. I remember thinking how the images on screen were perfectly complemented by this music. I remember watching with my mouth wide open.\\\"\\nI can think of no better illustration of the power \\\"Jaws\\\" that retains: Pokorny was present while its Hollywood mythology was being crafted, and he still can not swim in an ocean.\\nAs biologists have noted over the past 50 years, sharks ironically became the true victims of \\\"Jaws,\\\" villainized and exploited by industries that lobbed off fins for food. The upside is that sharks also became symbols of ocean conservation -- a cause that \\\"Jaws\\\" author Peter Benchley espoused during the last years of his life, before he died in 2006.\\nIn case you're wondering, the Florida-based International Shark Attack File says that, since 1975, less than 60 people have been killed by great white sharks, worldwide. Not one of those people was swimming in Lake Michigan. According to the Coast Guard's Great Lakes offices in Cleveland, shark sightings across the Midwest are now basically zilch.\\nStill, Willink, of the Illinois Natural History Survey, said he was vacationing last year on the South Carolina coast when he noticed a fin slice the ocean surface, not far from his son. They had recently watched the film for the first time, and though his son showed no fear of swimming in oceans, Willink's heart jumped into his throat. The scene in which a mother \\\"is wandering hopelessly and in grief along the surf is seared in my memory.\\\"\\nThat fin belonged to a bottlenose dolphin.\\n\\\"But my first thought was the movie 'Jaws.' \\\"\\n\\nThe Music Box hosts a 50th anniversary screening of \\\"Jaws\\\" in 35mm at 9 p.m. May 26; musicboxtheatre.com.

    "*   The primary obstacle encountered throughout the analysis was a persistent `ValueError` indicating a numpy dtype size mismatch when using the `gensim` library for creating the dictionary, corpus, and training the LDA model. This suggests a binary incompatibility between the installed versions of numpy and gensim within the execution environment.\n",
    "*   Attempts to resolve the library compatibility issue by uninstalling and reinstalling `numpy`, `scipy`, and `gensim` were unsuccessful, likely due to conflicts with other pre-installed libraries in the environment.\n",
    "*   As a direct consequence of the unresolved library compatibility issue, the creation of the dictionary and corpus, and subsequently the training and analysis of the LDA model, could not be completed.\n",
    "*   The final attempt to analyze the LDA results failed with a `NameError` because the `lda_model` object was not successfully created in the preceding steps due to the underlying library issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The environment requires a thorough review and potential reconstruction to ensure compatible versions of `numpy`, `scipy`, and `gensim` can be installed without conflicts with other necessary libraries.\n",

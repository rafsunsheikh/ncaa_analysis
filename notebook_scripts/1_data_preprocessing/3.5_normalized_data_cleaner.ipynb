In a 15-minute trip he covers what has been his universe for 53 of his 57 years. Six miles down the road is the farm where he grew up, preferring to shoot baskets and imitate Bob Cousy rather than hunt squirrel and pick peas. At Ruston High he made all-state in basketball, played on two state-title teams and coached. He became a basketball star across the street at Louisiana Tech, where he earned two degrees, met his wife of 36 years in a speech class and sent his daughter to college. It's also where Barmore has coached the women's basketball team to national prominence and into all 21 NCAA tournaments. The Lady Techsters play Friday against Cal-Santa Barbara. The story of the boy who made good locally also is the story of a college sports anomaly. Louisiana Tech, a power in the pre-NCAA days of women's basketball, remains an elite program despite the balance of power shifting to the large, state schools with big budgets. Tech and Old Dominion are the only schools to win Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and NCAA titles. Isolated, underfunded, without a power-conference affiliation and competing against new powers such as Connecticut, Iowa State and Oklahoma, Tech has recruiting disadvantages. But it also has a 3,500 average attendance, with fans so loyal some are buried with Tech souvenirs in their coffin, and a location close to talent bases. However, the biggest reason for its staying power has been Barmore and his powerful connection to the school and the town and his fierce defense of his program's tradition. \\\"We are Louisiana Tech,\\\" he says of his family. You can't take the Louisiana Tech out of the man. You also can't take the man out of Louisiana Tech. He has turned down attractive jobs, college and pro, to stay home, where his 20-year mark is 576- 86. His .870 winning percentage is the game's best. Two years ago he retired -- for all of 17 days. When the school couldn't find a suitable replacement, he was asked to return and couldn't say no. \\\"He'll do anything for his players,\\\" senior guard Brooke Lassiter says. Forward Ayana Walker, highly recruited in high school, chose Tech over North Carolina because it was closer to her home in Houston. Lassiter, who grew up a Tech fan two hours away in Portland, Ark., committed after her junior year. \\\"My family can come to games, and I have a chance at the Final Four every year,\\\" Lassiter says. \\\"That's a combination you can't beat. \\\"Once you're in the program, you're introduced to the tradition. They want you to know about it because they want you to have the desire to keep it going.\\\" Keeping it going has gotten harder. \\\"It's phenomenal what Leon's been able to do with that program,\\\" says Van Chancellor, coach of the WNBA champion Houston Comets. \\\"I'm truly amazed he has been able to maintain it.\\\" Says 2000 Olympic coach Nell Fortner, a former Tech assistant and now coach of the WNBA Indiana Fever, \\\"He is everything about that program. He is one of the best teachers of the game. He adapts to what his talent is. He has his priorities straight -- he's a family man, a religious man and loves his players -- so things don't get out of whack for him.\\\" Producing the results Barmore passes the credit around. The program was started by then- president Jay Taylor and coach Sonja Hogg in 1974-75. Barmore left the boys job at Ruston High to become Hogg's assistant in 1977. His thinking: use the job to get on campus and eventually assume the men's job. He was turned down twice for the men's job in the early '80s, then turned it down in the late '80s. \\\"It was too late then,\\\" he says. After Tech won the penultimate AIAW title in 1981 and the first NCAA title in 1982, Barmore was named co-coach with Hogg in 1982-83 and sole head coach in 1985-86. Under Barmore, Tech has been to nine NCAA Final Fours and won the 1988 title; his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. Everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one Final Four. He's had 12 All-Americans and has six players in the WNBA. Barmore points to school presidents Taylor and Dan Reneau, Taylor's successor, as reasons for Tech's success. \\\"I've had 11 athletic directors here, and some couldn't have cared less about women's basketball,\\\" Barmore says. \\\"The two presidents never wavered.\\\" Barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as Fortner, Gary Blair at Arkansas and Kristy Curry at Purdue. His assistant for 15 years, former Tech All-American Kim Mulkey-Robertson, his heir apparent, took the Baylor job, prompting Barmore's return. Realities in perspective While he has been given support, Barmore has not been showered with resources. His current recruiting budget: $15,000. He got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of $130,000. Other top coaches make from $250,000-$400,000. \\\"Do I sometimes resent it? Yes,\\\" he says of the resource disparities. \\\"But the president here should be making more money. We have great faculty who should be making more money. I've always been a team-first person. There are values more important than money. Where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is Leon Barmore is not bigger than this university or team. Leon Barmore is not bigger than his family.\\\" He has turned down tempting jobs. LSU came after him in the early '80s. The Comets wanted him in 1997 -- Chancellor was hired and won four consecutive WNBA titles -- and later the New York Liberty wooed him. \\\"It came down to family,\\\" Barmore says of his wife and daughter. \\\"I evaluated the happiness of all three of us. I thought the other two did not want to go. Two out of three wins every time, doesn't it?\\\" 'Darth Vader' tag lingers There's a small-town symmetry to his life. Two years ago Barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach Chris Long. He bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. When his wife, Rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, Shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. Barmore likes the rhythm of Ruston. He can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and doesn't need a starting time. Amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. He wonders why he isn't in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. \\\"He needs to be in there,\\\" Chancellor says. Barmore remembers Texas coach Jody Conradt called him \\\"Darth Vader\\\" in the late '80s and feels outsiders judge him by his game- face scowl, which can be intimidating. \\\"I've given my life to women's basketball,\\\" he says, \\\"yet I feel like so many don't understand or know me. They see the tough outer core.\\\" Players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. Lassiter has been on the receiving end of Barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: \\\"Deep down inside he cares about his players. Once you're around him, you see that.\\\" His driving tour over, Barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. He also repeats a favorite saying: \\\"No one has a lock on tradition. If you don't guard it, it's gone.\\\" He has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. \\\"The great story to me is that in the world of sport we've never taken a timeout. We've never disappeared. Who's to say it won't happen?\\\" Illustration PHOTOS,color,Bill Haber,AP(2); PHOTO,b/w,Gene J.

Robinson, the former Devils coach who is a special consultant with the team, said yesterday that he is certain to sit down with Sather as soon as the Devils-Mighty Ducks series is finished. \\\"If I wasn't interested, I wouldn't be talking to [Sather],\\\" Robinson said. The Bruins are rumored to have also asked the Devils for permission to speak with Robinson about their coaching vacancy, but Robinson said he is unaware of Boston's interest. Sather returns to New York this week and hopes to begin discussions with the representatives for unrestricted free agents Brian Leetch and Boris Mironov. Sather currently has no plans to interview any other coaching candidates. -Arthur Staple Lions Receiver Stabbed Detroit Lions receiver Scotty Anderson and his brother were stabbed in the parking lot of a Houston nightclub early yesterday after a scuffle with another club patron. Anderson's brother, Stevie, once a receiver with the Jets and Arizona Cardinals, was critically wounded and is hospitalized. Scotty Anderson's injuries didn't appear to be life-threatening, police spokesman Alvin Wright said. Two men were arrested after fleeing the scene, police said. Anderson is entering his third year with the Lions. He caught 25 passes for 322 yards and one touchdown last season. UCLA Wins Ninth Softball Title Keira Goerl threw a no-hitter and Toria Auelua drove in the game's only run with a single in the ninth inning, giving UCLA a 1- 0 victory over California in the title game of the NCAA softball championship in Oklahoma City. UCLA (54-7) won its ninth championship and first since 1999. California (49-20) was trying to become the first team since Arizona in 1996-97 to win back-to-back titles.

his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one final four. he s had 12 all-americans and has six players in the wnba. barmore points to school presidents taylor and dan reneau, taylor s successor, as reasons for tech s success. i have had 11 athletic directors here, and some could not have cared less about women s basketball, barmore says. the two presidents never wavered. barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as fortner, gary blair at arkansas and kristy curry at purdue. his assistant for 15 years, former tech all-american kim mulkey-robertson, his heir apparent, took the baylor job, prompting barmore s return. realities in perspective while he has been given support, barmore has not been showered with resources. his current recruiting budget: 15,000. he got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of 130,000. other top coaches make from 250,000- 400,000. do i sometimes resent it? yes, he says of the resource disparities. but the president here should be making more money. we have great faculty who should be making more money. i have always been a team-first person. there are values more important than money. where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is leon barmore is not bigger than this university or team. leon barmore is not bigger than his family. he has turned down tempting jobs. lsu came after him in the early 80s. the comets wanted him in 1997 -- chancellor was hired and won four consecutive wnba titles -- and later the new york liberty wooed him. it came down to family, barmore says of his wife and daughter. i evaluated the happiness of all three of us. i thought the other two did not want to go. two out of three wins every time, does not it? wouldarth vader tag lingers there s a small-town symmetry to his life. two years ago barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach chris long. he bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. when his wife, rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. barmore likes the rhythm of ruston. he can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and does not need a starting time. amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. he wonders why he is not in the women s basketball hall of fame. he needs to be in there, chancellor says. barmore remembers texas coach jody conradt called him darth vader in the late 80s and feels outsiders judge him by his game- face scowl, which can be intimidating. i have given my life to women s basketball, he says, yet i feel like so many do not understand or know me. they see the tough outer core. players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. lassiter has been on the receiving end of barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: deep down inside he cares about his players. once you are around him, you see that. his driving tour over, barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. he also repeats a favorite saying: no one has a lock on tradition. if you do not guard it, it s gone. he has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. the great story to me is that in the world of sport we have never taken a timeout. we have never disappeared. who s to say it will not happen? illustration photos,color,bill haber,ap 2 ;

In a 15-minute trip he covers what has been his universe for 53 of his 57 years. Six miles down the road is the farm where he grew up, preferring to shoot baskets and imitate Bob Cousy rather than hunt squirrel and pick peas. At Ruston High he made all-state in basketball, played on two state-title teams and coached. He became a basketball star across the street at Louisiana Tech, where he earned two degrees, met his wife of 36 years in a speech class and sent his daughter to college. It's also where Barmore has coached the women's basketball team to national prominence and into all 21 NCAA tournaments. The Lady Techsters play Friday against Cal-Santa Barbara. The story of the boy who made good locally also is the story of a college sports anomaly. Louisiana Tech, a power in the pre-NCAA days of women's basketball, remains an elite program despite the balance of power shifting to the large, state schools with big budgets. Tech and Old Dominion are the only schools to win Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and NCAA titles. Isolated, underfunded, without a power-conference affiliation and competing against new powers such as Connecticut, Iowa State and Oklahoma, Tech has recruiting disadvantages. But it also has a 3,500 average attendance, with fans so loyal some are buried with Tech souvenirs in their coffin, and a location close to talent bases. However, the biggest reason for its staying power has been Barmore and his powerful connection to the school and the town and his fierce defense of his program's tradition. \\\"We are Louisiana Tech,\\\" he says of his family. You can't take the Louisiana Tech out of the man. You also can't take the man out of Louisiana Tech. He has turned down attractive jobs, college and pro, to stay home, where his 20-year mark is 576- 86. His .870 winning percentage is the game's best. Two years ago he retired -- for all of 17 days. When the school couldn't find a suitable replacement, he was asked to return and couldn't say no. \\\"He'll do anything for his players,\\\" senior guard Brooke Lassiter says. Forward Ayana Walker, highly recruited in high school, chose Tech over North Carolina because it was closer to her home in Houston. Lassiter, who grew up a Tech fan two hours away in Portland, Ark., committed after her junior year. \\\"My family can come to games, and I have a chance at the Final Four every year,\\\" Lassiter says. \\\"That's a combination you can't beat. \\\"Once you're in the program, you're introduced to the tradition. They want you to know about it because they want you to have the desire to keep it going.\\\" Keeping it going has gotten harder. \\\"It's phenomenal what Leon's been able to do with that program,\\\" says Van Chancellor, coach of the WNBA champion Houston Comets. \\\"I'm truly amazed he has been able to maintain it.\\\" Says 2000 Olympic coach Nell Fortner, a former Tech assistant and now coach of the WNBA Indiana Fever, \\\"He is everything about that program. He is one of the best teachers of the game. He adapts to what his talent is. He has his priorities straight -- he's a family man, a religious man and loves his players -- so things don't get out of whack for him.\\\" Producing the results Barmore passes the credit around. The program was started by then- president Jay Taylor and coach Sonja Hogg in 1974-75. Barmore left the boys job at Ruston High to become Hogg's assistant in 1977. His thinking: use the job to get on campus and eventually assume the men's job. He was turned down twice for the men's job in the early '80s, then turned it down in the late '80s. \\\"It was too late then,\\\" he says. After Tech won the penultimate AIAW title in 1981 and the first NCAA title in 1982, Barmore was named co-coach with Hogg in 1982-83 and sole head coach in 1985-86. Under Barmore, Tech has been to nine NCAA Final Fours and won the 1988 title; his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. Everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one Final Four. He's had 12 All-Americans and has six players in the WNBA. Barmore points to school presidents Taylor and Dan Reneau, Taylor's successor, as reasons for Tech's success. \\\"I've had 11 athletic directors here, and some couldn't have cared less about women's basketball,\\\" Barmore says. \\\"The two presidents never wavered.\\\" Barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as Fortner, Gary Blair at Arkansas and Kristy Curry at Purdue. His assistant for 15 years, former Tech All-American Kim Mulkey-Robertson, his heir apparent, took the Baylor job, prompting Barmore's return. Realities in perspective While he has been given support, Barmore has not been showered with resources. His current recruiting budget: $15,000. He got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of $130,000. Other top coaches make from $250,000-$400,000. \\\"Do I sometimes resent it? Yes,\\\" he says of the resource disparities. \\\"But the president here should be making more money. We have great faculty who should be making more money. I've always been a team-first person. There are values more important than money. Where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is Leon Barmore is not bigger than this university or team. Leon Barmore is not bigger than his family.\\\" He has turned down tempting jobs. LSU came after him in the early '80s. The Comets wanted him in 1997 -- Chancellor was hired and won four consecutive WNBA titles -- and later the New York Liberty wooed him. \\\"It came down to family,\\\" Barmore says of his wife and daughter. \\\"I evaluated the happiness of all three of us. I thought the other two did not want to go. Two out of three wins every time, doesn't it?\\\" 'Darth Vader' tag lingers There's a small-town symmetry to his life. Two years ago Barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach Chris Long. He bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. When his wife, Rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, Shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. Barmore likes the rhythm of Ruston. He can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and doesn't need a starting time. Amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. He wonders why he isn't in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. \\\"He needs to be in there,\\\" Chancellor says. Barmore remembers Texas coach Jody Conradt called him \\\"Darth Vader\\\" in the late '80s and feels outsiders judge him by his game- face scowl, which can be intimidating. \\\"I've given my life to women's basketball,\\\" he says, \\\"yet I feel like so many don't understand or know me. They see the tough outer core.\\\" Players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. Lassiter has been on the receiving end of Barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: \\\"Deep down inside he cares about his players. Once you're around him, you see that.\\\" His driving tour over, Barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. He also repeats a favorite saying: \\\"No one has a lock on tradition. If you don't guard it, it's gone.\\\" He has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. \\\"The great story to me is that in the world of sport we've never taken a timeout. We've never disappeared. Who's to say it won't happen?\\\" Illustration PHOTOS,color,Bill Haber,AP(2); PHOTO,b/w,Gene J.

Robinson, the former Devils coach who is a special consultant with the team, said yesterday that he is certain to sit down with Sather as soon as the Devils-Mighty Ducks series is finished. \\\"If I wasn't interested, I wouldn't be talking to [Sather],\\\" Robinson said. The Bruins are rumored to have also asked the Devils for permission to speak with Robinson about their coaching vacancy, but Robinson said he is unaware of Boston's interest. Sather returns to New York this week and hopes to begin discussions with the representatives for unrestricted free agents Brian Leetch and Boris Mironov. Sather currently has no plans to interview any other coaching candidates. -Arthur Staple Lions Receiver Stabbed Detroit Lions receiver Scotty Anderson and his brother were stabbed in the parking lot of a Houston nightclub early yesterday after a scuffle with another club patron. Anderson's brother, Stevie, once a receiver with the Jets and Arizona Cardinals, was critically wounded and is hospitalized. Scotty Anderson's injuries didn't appear to be life-threatening, police spokesman Alvin Wright said. Two men were arrested after fleeing the scene, police said. Anderson is entering his third year with the Lions. He caught 25 passes for 322 yards and one touchdown last season. UCLA Wins Ninth Softball Title Keira Goerl threw a no-hitter and Toria Auelua drove in the game's only run with a single in the ninth inning, giving UCLA a 1- 0 victory over California in the title game of the NCAA softball championship in Oklahoma City. UCLA (54-7) won its ninth championship and first since 1999. California (49-20) was trying to become the first team since Arizona in 1996-97 to win back-to-back titles.

In a 15-minute trip he covers what has been his universe for 53 of his 57 years. Six miles down the road is the farm where he grew up, preferring to shoot baskets and imitate Bob Cousy rather than hunt squirrel and pick peas. At Ruston High he made all-state in basketball, played on two state-title teams and coached. He became a basketball star across the street at Louisiana Tech, where he earned two degrees, met his wife of 36 years in a speech class and sent his daughter to college. It's also where Barmore has coached the women's basketball team to national prominence and into all 21 NCAA tournaments. The Lady Techsters play Friday against Cal-Santa Barbara. The story of the boy who made good locally also is the story of a college sports anomaly. Louisiana Tech, a power in the pre-NCAA days of women's basketball, remains an elite program despite the balance of power shifting to the large, state schools with big budgets. Tech and Old Dominion are the only schools to win Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and NCAA titles. Isolated, underfunded, without a power-conference affiliation and competing against new powers such as Connecticut, Iowa State and Oklahoma, Tech has recruiting disadvantages. But it also has a 3,500 average attendance, with fans so loyal some are buried with Tech souvenirs in their coffin, and a location close to talent bases. However, the biggest reason for its staying power has been Barmore and his powerful connection to the school and the town and his fierce defense of his program's tradition. \\\"We are Louisiana Tech,\\\" he says of his family. You can't take the Louisiana Tech out of the man. You also can't take the man out of Louisiana Tech. He has turned down attractive jobs, college and pro, to stay home, where his 20-year mark is 576- 86. His .870 winning percentage is the game's best. Two years ago he retired -- for all of 17 days. When the school couldn't find a suitable replacement, he was asked to return and couldn't say no. \\\"He'll do anything for his players,\\\" senior guard Brooke Lassiter says. Forward Ayana Walker, highly recruited in high school, chose Tech over North Carolina because it was closer to her home in Houston. Lassiter, who grew up a Tech fan two hours away in Portland, Ark., committed after her junior year. \\\"My family can come to games, and I have a chance at the Final Four every year,\\\" Lassiter says. \\\"That's a combination you can't beat. \\\"Once you're in the program, you're introduced to the tradition. They want you to know about it because they want you to have the desire to keep it going.\\\" Keeping it going has gotten harder. \\\"It's phenomenal what Leon's been able to do with that program,\\\" says Van Chancellor, coach of the WNBA champion Houston Comets. \\\"I'm truly amazed he has been able to maintain it.\\\" Says 2000 Olympic coach Nell Fortner, a former Tech assistant and now coach of the WNBA Indiana Fever, \\\"He is everything about that program. He is one of the best teachers of the game. He adapts to what his talent is. He has his priorities straight -- he's a family man, a religious man and loves his players -- so things don't get out of whack for him.\\\" Producing the results Barmore passes the credit around. The program was started by then- president Jay Taylor and coach Sonja Hogg in 1974-75. Barmore left the boys job at Ruston High to become Hogg's assistant in 1977. His thinking: use the job to get on campus and eventually assume the men's job. He was turned down twice for the men's job in the early '80s, then turned it down in the late '80s. \\\"It was too late then,\\\" he says. After Tech won the penultimate AIAW title in 1981 and the first NCAA title in 1982, Barmore was named co-coach with Hogg in 1982-83 and sole head coach in 1985-86. Under Barmore, Tech has been to nine NCAA Final Fours and won the 1988 title; his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. Everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one Final Four. He's had 12 All-Americans and has six players in the WNBA. Barmore points to school presidents Taylor and Dan Reneau, Taylor's successor, as reasons for Tech's success. \\\"I've had 11 athletic directors here, and some couldn't have cared less about women's basketball,\\\" Barmore says. \\\"The two presidents never wavered.\\\" Barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as Fortner, Gary Blair at Arkansas and Kristy Curry at Purdue. His assistant for 15 years, former Tech All-American Kim Mulkey-Robertson, his heir apparent, took the Baylor job, prompting Barmore's return. Realities in perspective While he has been given support, Barmore has not been showered with resources. His current recruiting budget: $15,000. He got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of $130,000. Other top coaches make from $250,000-$400,000. \\\"Do I sometimes resent it? Yes,\\\" he says of the resource disparities. \\\"But the president here should be making more money. We have great faculty who should be making more money. I've always been a team-first person. There are values more important than money. Where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is Leon Barmore is not bigger than this university or team. Leon Barmore is not bigger than his family.\\\" He has turned down tempting jobs. LSU came after him in the early '80s. The Comets wanted him in 1997 -- Chancellor was hired and won four consecutive WNBA titles -- and later the New York Liberty wooed him. \\\"It came down to family,\\\" Barmore says of his wife and daughter. \\\"I evaluated the happiness of all three of us. I thought the other two did not want to go. Two out of three wins every time, doesn't it?\\\" 'Darth Vader' tag lingers There's a small-town symmetry to his life. Two years ago Barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach Chris Long. He bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. When his wife, Rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, Shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. Barmore likes the rhythm of Ruston. He can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and doesn't need a starting time. Amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. He wonders why he isn't in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. \\\"He needs to be in there,\\\" Chancellor says. Barmore remembers Texas coach Jody Conradt called him \\\"Darth Vader\\\" in the late '80s and feels outsiders judge him by his game- face scowl, which can be intimidating. \\\"I've given my life to women's basketball,\\\" he says, \\\"yet I feel like so many don't understand or know me. They see the tough outer core.\\\" Players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. Lassiter has been on the receiving end of Barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: \\\"Deep down inside he cares about his players. Once you're around him, you see that.\\\" His driving tour over, Barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. He also repeats a favorite saying: \\\"No one has a lock on tradition. If you don't guard it, it's gone.\\\" He has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. \\\"The great story to me is that in the world of sport we've never taken a timeout. We've never disappeared. Who's to say it won't happen?\\\" Illustration PHOTOS,color,Bill Haber,AP(2); PHOTO,b/w,Gene J. Puskar,AP; Caption: Leon BarmoreAll-around: Ayana Bird\\\" Walker averages 13.5 points and 9.3 rebounds. Man of varied faces: Leon Barmore is known for his scowl but also for his generosity, loyalty.

Robinson, the former Devils coach who is a special consultant with the team, said yesterday that he is certain to sit down with Sather as soon as the Devils-Mighty Ducks series is finished. \\\"If I wasn't interested, I wouldn't be talking to [Sather],\\\" Robinson said. The Bruins are rumored to have also asked the Devils for permission to speak with Robinson about their coaching vacancy, but Robinson said he is unaware of Boston's interest. Sather returns to New York this week and hopes to begin discussions with the representatives for unrestricted free agents Brian Leetch and Boris Mironov. Sather currently has no plans to interview any other coaching candidates. -Arthur Staple Lions Receiver Stabbed Detroit Lions receiver Scotty Anderson and his brother were stabbed in the parking lot of a Houston nightclub early yesterday after a scuffle with another club patron. Anderson's brother, Stevie, once a receiver with the Jets and Arizona Cardinals, was critically wounded and is hospitalized. Scotty Anderson's injuries didn't appear to be life-threatening, police spokesman Alvin Wright said. Two men were arrested after fleeing the scene, police said. Anderson is entering his third year with the Lions. He caught 25 passes for 322 yards and one touchdown last season. UCLA Wins Ninth Softball Title Keira Goerl threw a no-hitter and Toria Auelua drove in the game's only run with a single in the ninth inning, giving UCLA a 1- 0 victory over California in the title game of the NCAA softball championship in Oklahoma City. UCLA (54-7) won its ninth championship and first since 1999. California (49-20) was trying to become the first team since Arizona in 1996-97 to win back-to-back titles.

his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one final four. he s had 12 all-americans and has six players in the wnba. barmore points to school presidents taylor and dan reneau, taylor s successor, as reasons for tech s success. i have had 11 athletic directors here, and some could not have cared less about women s basketball, barmore says. the two presidents never wavered. barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as fortner, gary blair at arkansas and kristy curry at purdue. his assistant for 15 years, former tech all-american kim mulkey-robertson, his heir apparent, took the baylor job, prompting barmore s return. realities in perspective while he has been given support, barmore has not been showered with resources. his current recruiting budget: 15,000. he got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of 130,000. other top coaches make from 250,000- 400,000. do i sometimes resent it? yes, he says of the resource disparities. but the president here should be making more money. we have great faculty who should be making more money. i have always been a team-first person. there are values more important than money. where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is leon barmore is not bigger than this university or team. leon barmore is not bigger than his family. he has turned down tempting jobs. lsu came after him in the early 80s. the comets wanted him in 1997 -- chancellor was hired and won four consecutive wnba titles -- and later the new york liberty wooed him. it came down to family, barmore says of his wife and daughter. i evaluated the happiness of all three of us. i thought the other two did not want to go. two out of three wins every time, does not it? wouldarth vader tag lingers there s a small-town symmetry to his life. two years ago barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach chris long. he bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. when his wife, rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. barmore likes the rhythm of ruston. he can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and does not need a starting time. amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. he wonders why he is not in the women s basketball hall of fame. he needs to be in there, chancellor says. barmore remembers texas coach jody conradt called him darth vader in the late 80s and feels outsiders judge him by his - face scowl, which can be intimidating. i have given my life to women s basketball, he says, yet i feel like so many do not understand or know me. they see the tough outer core. players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. lassiter has been on the receiving end of barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: deep down inside he cares about his players. once you are around him, you see that. his driving tour over, barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. he also repeats a favorite saying: no one has a lock on tradition. if you do not guard it, it s gone. he has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. the great story to me is that in the world of sport we have never taken a timeout. we have never disappeared. who s to say it will not happen? illustration photos,color,bill haber,ap 2 ;

At Ruston High he made all-state in basketball, played on two state-title teams and coached. He became a basketball star across the street at Louisiana Tech, where he earned two degrees, met his wife of 36 years in a speech class and sent his daughter to college. It's also where Barmore has coached the women's basketball team to national prominence and into all 21 NCAA tournaments. The Lady Techsters play Friday against Cal-Santa Barbara. The story of the boy who made good locally also is the story of a college sports anomaly. Louisiana Tech, a power in the pre-NCAA days of women's basketball, remains an elite program despite the balance of power shifting to the large, state schools with big budgets. Tech and Old Dominion are the only schools to win Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and NCAA titles. Isolated, underfunded, without a power-conference affiliation and competing against new powers such as Connecticut, Iowa State and Oklahoma, Tech has recruiting disadvantages. But it also has a 3,500 average attendance, with fans so loyal some are buried with Tech souvenirs in their coffin, and a location close to talent bases. However, the biggest reason for its staying power has been Barmore and his powerful connection to the school and the town and his fierce defense of his program's tradition. \\\"We are Louisiana Tech,\\\" he says of his family. You can't take the Louisiana Tech out of the man. You also can't take the man out of Louisiana Tech. He has turned down attractive jobs, college and pro, to stay home, where his 20-year mark is 576- 86. His .870 winning percentage is the game's best. Two years ago he retired -- for all of 17 days. When the school couldn't find a suitable replacement, he was asked to return and couldn't say no. \\\"He'll do anything for his players,\\\" senior guard Brooke Lassiter says. Forward Ayana Walker, highly recruited in high school, chose Tech over North Carolina because it was closer to her home in Houston. Lassiter, who grew up a Tech fan two hours away in Portland, Ark., committed after her junior year. \\\"My family can come to games, and I have a chance at the Final Four every year,\\\" Lassiter says. \\\"That's a combination you can't beat. \\\"Once you're in the program, you're introduced to the tradition. They want you to know about it because they want you to have the desire to keep it going.\\\" Keeping it going has gotten harder. \\\"It's phenomenal what Leon's been able to do with that program,\\\" says Van Chancellor, coach of the WNBA champion Houston Comets. \\\"I'm truly amazed he has been able to maintain it.\\\" Says 2000 Olympic coach Nell Fortner, a former Tech assistant and now coach of the WNBA Indiana Fever, \\\"He is everything about that program. He is one of the best teachers of the game. He adapts to what his talent is. He has his priorities straight -- he's a family man, a religious man and loves his players -- so things don't get out of whack for him.\\\" Producing the results Barmore passes the credit around. The program was started by then- president Jay Taylor and coach Sonja Hogg in 1974-75. Barmore left the boys job at Ruston High to become Hogg's assistant in 1977. His thinking: use the job to get on campus and eventually assume the men's job. He was turned down twice for the men's job in the early '80s, then turned it down in the late '80s. \\\"It was too late then,\\\" he says. After Tech won the penultimate AIAW title in 1981 and the first NCAA title in 1982, Barmore was named co-coach with Hogg in 1982-83 and sole head coach in 1985-86. Under Barmore, Tech has been to nine NCAA Final Fours and won the 1988 title; his worst record, 18-12, was in 1990-91. Everyone who has played four years has gone to at least one Final Four. He's had 12 All-Americans and has six players in the WNBA. Barmore points to school presidents Taylor and Dan Reneau, Taylor's successor, as reasons for Tech's success. \\\"I've had 11 athletic directors here, and some couldn't have cared less about women's basketball,\\\" Barmore says. \\\"The two presidents never wavered.\\\" Barmore also has had a string of outstanding assistant coaches, including such current head coaches as Fortner, Gary Blair at Arkansas and Kristy Curry at Purdue. His assistant for 15 years, former Tech All-American Kim Mulkey-Robertson, his heir apparent, took the Baylor job, prompting Barmore's return. Realities in perspective While he has been given support, Barmore has not been showered with resources. His current recruiting budget: $15,000. He got a bump in salary five years ago and now has a base of $130,000. Other top coaches make from $250,000-$400,000. \\\"Do I sometimes resent it? Yes,\\\" he says of the resource disparities. \\\"But the president here should be making more money. We have great faculty who should be making more money. I've always been a team-first person. There are values more important than money. Where you keep yourself under control and in perspective is Leon Barmore is not bigger than this university or team. Leon Barmore is not bigger than his family.\\\" He has turned down tempting jobs. LSU came after him in the early '80s. The Comets wanted him in 1997 -- Chancellor was hired and won four consecutive WNBA titles -- and later the New York Liberty wooed him. \\\"It came down to family,\\\" Barmore says of his wife and daughter. \\\"I evaluated the happiness of all three of us. I thought the other two did not want to go. Two out of three wins every time, doesn't it?\\\" 'Darth Vader' tag lingers There's a small-town symmetry to his life. Two years ago Barmore sold his home of 28 years, a mile from campus, to assistant coach Chris Long. He bought a dream home 3 miles from campus. When his wife, Rachel, retired after 31 years as a fifth-grade teacher, their daughter, Shannon, began teaching third grade at the same school. Barmore likes the rhythm of Ruston. He can be at a good golf course in less than 15 minutes and doesn't need a starting time. Amid the contentment, there is concern about his legacy. He wonders why he isn't in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. \\\"He needs to be in there,\\\" Chancellor says. Barmore remembers Texas coach Jody Conradt called him \\\"Darth Vader\\\" in the late '80s and feels outsiders judge him by his game- face scowl, which can be intimidating. \\\"I've given my life to women's basketball,\\\" he says, \\\"yet I feel like so many don't understand or know me. They see the tough outer core.\\\" Players, assistants and friends tell stories about his generosity and loyalty. Lassiter has been on the receiving end of Barmore stares as well as encouraging notes and phone calls: \\\"Deep down inside he cares about his players. Once you're around him, you see that.\\\" His driving tour over, Barmore sits at the cafe, recalling country music lyrics over fried catfish, boiled potatoes, corn and sweetened iced tea. He also repeats a favorite saying: \\\"No one has a lock on tradition. If you don't guard it, it's gone.\\\" He has guarded the tradition for 20 years, at his favorite school, in his favorite town. \\\"The great story to me is that in the world of sport we've never taken a timeout. We've never disappeared. Who's to say it won't happen?\\\" Illustration PHOTOS,color,Bill Haber,AP(2); PHOTO,b/w,Gene J.

Robinson, the former Devils coach who is a special consultant with the team, said yesterday that he is certain to sit down with Sather as soon as the Devils-Mighty Ducks series is finished. \\\"If I wasn't interested, I wouldn't be talking to [Sather],\\\" Robinson said. The Bruins are rumored to have also asked the Devils for permission to speak with Robinson about their coaching vacancy, but Robinson said he is unaware of Boston's interest. Sather returns to New York this week and hopes to begin discussions with the representatives for unrestricted free agents Brian Leetch and Boris Mironov. Sather currently has no plans to interview any other coaching candidates. -Arthur Staple Lions Receiver Stabbed Detroit Lions receiver Scotty Anderson and his brother were stabbed in the parking lot of a Houston nightclub early yesterday after a scuffle with another club patron. Anderson's brother, Stevie, once a receiver with the Jets and Arizona Cardinals, was critically wounded and is hospitalized. Scotty Anderson's injuries didn't appear to be life-threatening, police spokesman Alvin Wright said. Two men were arrested after fleeing the scene, police said. Anderson is entering his third year with the Lions. He caught 25 passes for 322 yards and one touchdown last season. UCLA Wins Ninth Softball Title Keira Goerl threw a no-hitter and Toria Auelua drove in the game's only run with a single in the ninth inning, giving UCLA a 1- 0 victory over California in the title game of the NCAA softball championship in Oklahoma City. UCLA (54-7) won its ninth championship and first since 1999. California (49-20) was trying to become the first team since Arizona in 1996-97 to win back-to-back titles.
